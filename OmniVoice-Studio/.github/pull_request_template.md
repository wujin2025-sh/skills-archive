## Release cadence

VoiceStudio ships **continuous-to-main** — no release candidates, no soak windows.
Every merged PR is immediately part of the rolling preview (`main`, Docker
`:latest`, the desktop Preview channel). Versioned releases are tagged from
`main` when it's ready; `main` then bumps to the next patch automatically.
Users who want stability pin a release tag / Docker `:stable` / the desktop
Stable channel.
