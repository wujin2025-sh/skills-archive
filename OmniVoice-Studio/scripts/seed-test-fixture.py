"""
Deterministic builder for `tests/fixtures/omnivoice_data/` — the frozen
regression fixture loaded by PR smoke tests (GATE-01).

Usage (from repo root):
    uv run python scripts/seed-test-fixture.py

What it produces (≤ 200 KB total):
    tests/fixtures/omnivoice_data/
    ├── omnivoice.db                          # all 8 tables, 1 voice_profiles row, 0 history rows
    ├── voices/test-voice/
    │   ├── profile.json                      # mirrors the voice_profiles row
    │   └── sample.wav                        # 1-sec 24 kHz mono silence (~48 KB)
    └── README.md                             # explains the fixture + rebuild path

The script is idempotent: an existing fixture directory is wiped and rebuilt.
Inputs are entirely deterministic (fixed timestamp, all-zero PCM samples) so
re-running this script produces a byte-identical fixture for git diffs.

Why this exists: every PR runs `tests/smoke/test_boot_smoke.py` against this
fixture on macOS / Windows / Linux. If the fixture drifts uncontrollably,
the smoke matrix loses its meaning. Keeping it tiny + reproducible is the
whole point of GATE-01.
