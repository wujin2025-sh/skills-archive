# desktop-prod.sh — Build & launch VoiceStudio as a "fresh install"
#
# This gives you the EXACT same experience as a user downloading the
# installer (DMG on macOS, AppImage on Linux):
#   • Full Rust bootstrap (venv creation, uv sync, model setup)
#   • Splash screen with live logs
#   • Region selector, version badge, etc.
#
# Usage:
#   bun desktop-prod          # build debug + wipe + launch
#   bun desktop-prod:run      # re-launch last build (skip compile, keep data)
#   bun desktop-prod:upgrade  # rebuild, but keep data (test upgrade)
#
# NOTE on the flags (#1333): --skip-build and --keep-data are INDEPENDENT.
# --skip-build only skips the compile; on its own it still wipes app data,
# which is why `desktop-prod:run` passes --keep-data too. Wiping is the
# default because this script exists to emulate a first install; a plain
# re-launch is not that, and must not cost you your voice profiles.
#
# For a stricter NEW-USER emulation on macOS (webview localStorage, prefs,
# caches wiped too + launch with a dev-tools-hidden environment), see
# `bun desktop-fresh` (scripts/desktop-fresh.mjs).

# ── Kill before launch (and before any wipe) ───────────────────────────────
# Two independent reasons, which is why this is unconditional (#1333 review):
#
# 1. Wipe: a backend that survives it becomes a zombie — /health keeps
#    answering from memory, the next launch attaches to it, and every real
#    route 500s off deleted files + an empty DB.
# 2. Launch: the app registers tauri_plugin_single_instance, whose callback
#    IGNORES the new argv and merely refocuses the window the running process
#    already has. So starting a second copy over a live one silently does
#    nothing — `desktop-prod:run` would refocus the OLD build instead of
#    running the one just compiled, and `desktop-prod:run:pill` would leave
#    you looking at studio mode with --pill quietly discarded.
#
# Reason 2 applies whatever the data policy is, so this must not sit inside
# the KEEP_DATA branch.
#
# The kill is scoped to THIS checkout's build artifacts. A bare `${APP_NAME}.app`
# pattern also matches an installed /Applications copy, and killing that costs a
# developer unsaved work in a session this script never started (greptile) —
# previously masked because the kill only ran on wipe runs, where the developer
# had already asked for a clean slate. An installed copy still cannot be ignored
# outright (single-instance would swallow this launch), so it gets a warning.
