# Build all demo assets for VoiceStudio v0.3.0.
#
# Two render paths:
#   1. macOS `say` (default) — fast, deterministic, ships immediately.
#      Used to bootstrap the demo bundle so v0.3.0 has working demos on day one.
#   2. VoiceStudio engine (--engine omnivoice) — production-quality re-render
#      once model weights are cached. Recipes documented but not executed
#      until the user opts in.
#
# All outputs are committed to the repo so end-users never need to re-render.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_demos.sh                # render via `say`, overwrite all assets
#   scripts/build_demos.sh --skip-existing  # only render files that don't exist
#   scripts/build_demos.sh --engine omnivoice  # re-render via the real engine
#                                          # (requires .venv + weights)
#
# Outputs land in:
#   backend/assets/samples/demo_voice.wav              (clone reference)
#   backend/assets/samples/demo_clone_output.wav       (clone pre-rendered out)
#   backend/assets/samples/voice_design/demo_voice_design_*.wav  (7 design presets)
#   backend/assets/samples/dictation/{en_conversational,en_technical,fr_reservation}.wav
#
# License: all `say`-rendered output is synthetic speech from Apple's bundled
# TTS voices, redistributable under the VoiceStudio MIT license per Apple's
# Voices for Accessibility EULA. No third-party voice IP is used.
