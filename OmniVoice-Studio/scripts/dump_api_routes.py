The snapshot (`tests/fixtures/api_routes.txt`) is the committed inventory of
every HTTP/WebSocket route the FastAPI app exposes. `tests/test_api_route_
inventory.py` diffs the live app against it, so an accidentally removed or
renamed endpoint fails CI. When you intentionally add/remove/rename a route,
run this script and commit the updated snapshot.
