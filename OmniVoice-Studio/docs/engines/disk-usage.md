# Engine venvs & disk usage

Most engines run in-process in VoiceStudio's main environment. A few
(**IndexTTS2**, **MOSS-TTS-v1.5**, **dots.tts**, and any engine whose
dependencies conflict with the parent's `torch`/`transformers` pins) run in a
**dedicated sidecar venv** so their pins can't break the rest of the app. Those
sidecars are where disk adds up — this page explains why, and how the on-disk
cost is kept down.

## Why a sidecar needs its own venv

IndexTTS2 pins `transformers<5`, but VoiceStudio requires `transformers>=5.3`.
You can't have both in one environment, so IndexTTS2 gets its own venv created
on first use (`uv venv` + `uv pip install`, see
`backend/engines/indextts/bootstrap.py`). The cost is a second copy of the
heavy ML stack — most of which is **torch + the bundled CUDA libraries**.

## How big is "a second torch"?

Measured (2026-06):

| Platform | torch CUDA wheel | + bundled CUDA libs |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (cu128) | ~0.83 GiB | several GiB of `nvidia-*` packages on top |
| Windows (cu128) | ~3.2 GiB (DLLs bundled in the wheel) | — |

So a sidecar that pins a **different** torch version than the parent is a
multi-GB add. A sidecar that pins the **same** torch + CUDA build shares almost
all of it (see below).

## uv dedupes identical wheels — for free, with one condition

uv installs packages by linking from a global wheel cache into each venv's
`site-packages`. The link mode:

- **macOS + Linux** — `clone` (copy-on-write reflink). N venvs that install the
  same wheel share the bytes until one is modified — effectively one copy on
  disk.
- **Windows** — `hardlink`. Same effect on a single volume.

**The one condition:** the cache and the venv must be on the **same
filesystem**. If `UV_CACHE_DIR` lives on a different drive than the engine
venvs, uv falls back to a full **copy** (no dedup, slower). Keep them together.

Dedup is **per identical wheel**. `torch==2.6.0+cu124` and `torch==2.8.0+cu128`
are different wheels → **zero** sharing → a full extra multi-GB copy. The single
biggest disk decision for a sidecar is therefore: **pin the same torch build as
the parent whenever the engine allows it.** When it doesn't (IndexTTS2's
`transformers<5` forces an older torch line), the second copy is the
unavoidable price of isolation — not a bug.

The opt-in #498 engines illustrate both sides: **dots.tts** pins
`torch==2.8.0` — the **same** build the parent constrains to — so it shares
almost all of torch with the main venv and only its `transformers==4.57` +
model deps are new. **MOSS-TTS-v1.5** pins `torch==2.9.1+cu128`, a **different**
build, so it pays a full extra multi-GB torch copy on CUDA hosts (the price of
running an 8B model whose stack pins `transformers==5.0`).

> On Linux, the `nvidia-*` CUDA packages are separate wheels, so even across
> *different* torch versions any `nvidia-*` whose pinned version happens to
> match is still shared. On Windows the CUDA DLLs live inside the one torch
> wheel, so nothing is shared across torch versions.

## Practical guidance

- Keep `UV_CACHE_DIR` and the engine venvs on one filesystem (the default —
  both under your home dir — already satisfies this). **The app enforces this
  automatically**: when the app env or the engine venvs live on a different
  volume than uv's default cache (D:-drive install, portable mode), every
  managed `uv` invocation gets `UV_CACHE_DIR` pointed at a cache next to the
  venvs (`<env root>/uv-cache`, `<data dir>/engines/.uv-cache`). An explicit
  `UV_CACHE_DIR` you set yourself always wins.
- On Linux ext4 (no reflink), `export UV_LINK_MODE=hardlink` guarantees dedup
  on any single filesystem; the default `clone` only dedupes on
  reflink-capable filesystems (XFS-with-reflink, btrfs, APFS).
- Reclaiming space: deleting a sidecar venv (`backend/engines/<id>/.venv/`)
  frees its unique files; shared cache bytes stay until `uv cache prune`.
- Forward-looking: PyTorch's experimental **wheel variants** (shipped in 2.8)
  will eventually let `uv install torch` auto-pick the right CUDA build, and
  uv already exposes `--torch-backend=auto`.
