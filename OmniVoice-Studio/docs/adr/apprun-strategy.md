# Decision — AppImage `AppRun` injection strategy

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Phase:** 01 (install + token persistence + docs + error UX)
**Wave:** 3
**Plan:** `01-03-PLAN.md`
**Issue:** #56 (AppImage white-screen on Fedora 44 / Ubuntu 24.04)
**Open Question resolved:** #1 from RESEARCH.md ("Where does AppRun live in this Tauri tree?")

---

## TL;DR

Tauri 2's AppImage bundler auto-generates an `AppRun` shell launcher inside the
`.AppImage` squashfs. There is no first-class `bundle.linux.appimage.template`
config key in Tauri 2.x as of this writing. The chosen injection strategy is:

> **A custom `AppRun` template sourced from `frontend/src-tauri/appimage/AppRun`
> is copied into the AppImage staging directory by a `beforeBundleCommand`
> (Tauri 2 supports this hook).**

The script that copies it lives at `scripts/inject-apprun.sh` and is invoked
from `package.json` via the existing `bun run build` pipeline, so the
operation is wired into the same `cargo tauri build --bundles appimage` call
the release pipeline already uses.

---

## Background — what Tauri 2's auto-generated AppRun does

When `cargo tauri build --bundles appimage` runs, Tauri's bundler:

1. Creates a staging directory under `target/release/bundle/appimage/${appname}.AppDir/`
2. Drops the main binary at `usr/bin/${binary_name}`
3. Generates an `AppRun` shell script at `${appname}.AppDir/AppRun` that:
   - Sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the bundled libs
   - Sets `XDG_DATA_DIRS` to include the AppDir's `usr/share`
   - `exec`s `usr/bin/${binary_name}` with `"$@"`
4. Packs the AppDir into a single-file AppImage via `appimagetool`

The auto-generated `AppRun` does **not** set
`WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE`. On Fedora 44 (and any distro shipping
WebKitGTK 2.44.x / 2.46.x with Wayland), this manifests as a white screen on
first launch — the GPU compositing path in those WebKit versions has a
documented regression that blanks out the surface.

## Strategies considered

### A. Custom `AppRun` template via `tauri.conf.json` config key

Status: **does not exist in Tauri 2 stable as of 2026-05.**
Tauri's `bundle.linux.appimage` accepts `bundleMediaFramework: bool` and
`files: HashMap<PathBuf, PathBuf>` but **not** an `appRun` / `template` key.
Tracking issue: `tauri-apps/tauri#7616` is still open.

### B. `beforeBundleCommand` hook (CHOSEN)

Tauri 2 added `build.beforeBundleCommand` as a sibling to `beforeBuildCommand`.
It runs AFTER `cargo build` but BEFORE the bundler packs the AppDir into an
AppImage. This is exactly the right point to swap the AppRun:
- The AppDir staging directory exists at a predictable path
  (`target/${profile}/bundle/appimage/*.AppDir/`)
- The auto-generated `AppRun` is already in place
- We just overwrite it with our version before `appimagetool` runs

Tradeoffs:
- ✓ No re-packing the squashfs after the fact (faster, simpler)
- ✓ One-line tauri.conf.json change + small shell script
- ✓ Cross-platform safe: the hook only fires when Linux + AppImage are in the
  active target list, so macOS/Windows builds are unaffected
- ✗ The staging path is glob-discovered (the .AppDir name follows
  `productName`), so the script handles `productName` changes gracefully

### C. Post-bundle re-pack with `appimagetool`

Status: **rejected.** This would require unpacking the AppImage's squashfs
after Tauri produces it, replacing AppRun, re-running `appimagetool --no-appstream`,
re-signing. Doable but doubles bundle time and adds appimagetool as an explicit
release-pipeline dep. Strategy B avoids both.

---

## Chosen strategy

**Strategy B — `beforeBundleCommand` hook + custom AppRun template.**

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src-tauri/appimage/AppRun` | The custom launcher shell script (source of truth, version-controlled) |
| `frontend/src-tauri/appimage/AppRun.test.sh` | Shell unit test (W-1) — 4 cases for the WebKit version conditional |
| `scripts/inject-apprun.sh` | Glob the AppDir under `frontend/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/*.AppDir/` and `cp -f` the AppRun in. Idempotent. |
| `frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `build.beforeBundleCommand` wires the hook into the bundler pipeline |

### Wire-up

```jsonc
// frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    "beforeBundleCommand": "bash ../../scripts/inject-apprun.sh"
    // ... existing keys
  }
}
```

The hook is a no-op when `--bundles appimage` is not in the active target
list (the script `glob`s for the AppDir; if none exist, it exits 0).

### Why `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE` is conditional, not unconditional

Per Pitfall #3 in RESEARCH.md: setting this env var on healthy WebKit versions
(2.48+) re-introduces the very compositing bug it was meant to work around on
Apple Silicon Linux ports. We detect the WebKit version via `pkg-config`
(both `webkit2gtk-4.1` and `webkit2gtk-4.0` are queried) and only set the
env var on the known-broken `2.44.x` and `2.46.x` ranges, plus the `pkg-config
absent / unknown version` fallback (fail-safe to the workaround).

## Future maintenance

When Tauri 2 ships a first-class `appRun` template key (see open
`tauri-apps/tauri#7616`), the migration is:

1. Move `frontend/src-tauri/appimage/AppRun` content into the new config key
2. Delete `scripts/inject-apprun.sh`
3. Remove the `beforeBundleCommand` line that invokes it
4. Keep `AppRun.test.sh` as-is — it still validates the conditional logic

Until then, the strategy here is the documented path.
