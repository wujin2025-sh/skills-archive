# VoiceStudio — Install on Linux

This page is self-contained: follow it top to bottom and you'll end up with a
working VoiceStudio install on a Debian / Ubuntu / Fedora / Arch host.

## Prerequisites

### Using the AppImage

- **Linux x86_64** with a desktop session (X11 or Wayland) capable of running
  a Tauri / WebKitGTK app.
- **~10 GB free disk** for the app, its Python environment, and model weights.
- Optional: an **NVIDIA driver** for CUDA GPU acceleration — the app runs
  CPU-only without one. For AMD GPUs see [AMD GPU (ROCm)](#amd-gpu-rocm).
That's it — Python, FFmpeg/FFprobe, yt-dlp, and the model weights are bundled
or bootstrapped by the app itself on first launch. No toolchain needed. (If no
FFmpeg resolves anywhere, the app downloads its own checksummed static build
in the background during setup; **Settings → Audio tools** shows exactly which
binaries are in use and lets you override them or update yt-dlp.)

### Building from source

Everything above, plus the toolchain:

- **git** — `sudo apt install git` (Debian/Ubuntu), `sudo dnf install git` (Fedora), or `sudo pacman -S git` (Arch).
- **curl** — usually preinstalled; used by the Bun and rustup install one-liners below.
- **Python 3.11+** — typically `sudo apt install python3.11` on Debian/Ubuntu,
  `sudo dnf install python3.11` on Fedora, or already installed on Arch.
- **Bun** — `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.
- **Rust / Cargo** — `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` or via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install rustc cargo`).
  If you use rustup, reopen the shell or source `"$HOME/.cargo/env"` before running `bun run desktop-prod`.
- **GTK/WebKit deps** for the Tauri shell:

  ```bash
  # Debian / Ubuntu
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libssl-dev libxdo-dev build-essential

  # Fedora
  sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel openssl-devel

  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel webkit2gtk-4.1 libayatana-appindicator librsvg openssl xdotool
  ```

- Optional: a **Hugging Face token** for diarization + the larger TTS engines
  (see [docs/setup/huggingface-token.md](../setup/huggingface-token.md)).

## Install (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio.git
cd VoiceStudio
bun install
bun run desktop-prod
```

The first launch creates the Python venv via `uv`, syncs deps, and downloads
model weights (~2.4 GB). Subsequent launches start in seconds.

## Install (AppImage)

Download the latest AppImage from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/releases/latest),
make it executable, and run:

```bash
chmod +x VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
```

No FUSE? Use `--appimage-extract-and-run`:

```bash
./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run
```

## .deb package

Not currently published: `.deb` bundling is disabled in the release pipeline
because of a `tauri-cli` bug (`Failed to create control scripts`) — see the
comment in `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the tracking note. The
AppImage above is the supported Linux install path until a `tauri-cli`
version resolves it. `apt install`-able `.deb`s shipped before v0.3 (see
[.deb ffprobe conflict](#deb-ffprobe-conflict) below) if you're upgrading
from one of those.

The desktop app uses these canonical paths (kept in sync with
`scripts/desktop-prod.sh` by the docs-drift CI gate):

<!-- validate -->
```bash
APP_ID="com.debpalash.omnivoice-studio"
APP_NAME="VoiceStudio"
```

## AppImage white screen / EGL errors (Fedora 44, Ubuntu 24.04+, 26.04)

<a id="appimage-white-screen-on-fedora-44--ubuntu-2404"></a>

Two separate WebKitGTK rendering issues land the Tauri window as a
fully-white frame with no UI. Which one you have depends on your WebKitGTK
version (`pkg-config --modversion webkit2gtk-4.1` prints it).

**Modern WebKitGTK (2.48+ — Ubuntu 24.04 and newer, incl. 26.04): try this
first.** WebKit's DMA-BUF renderer fails against some GPU drivers; the
terminal typically shows:

```
Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER
```

Disable the DMA-BUF renderer before launching:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 ./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
```

**WebKitGTK 2.44 / 2.46 (Fedora 44, Ubuntu 24.04 at release):** a
compositing-mode regression blanks the surface on first paint. Disable
compositing mode instead:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 ./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
```

VoiceStudio's AppRun launcher autodetects the broken 2.44/2.46 range and sets
this second variable for you (shipped in v0.3+). The manual env-var path
remains the documented fallback when running from a checked-out source tree.

**Last resort** — if neither variable alone helps, force software rendering
(slower, but always paints):

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
```

### If no environment variable helps at all (Mesa 26.1+)

On a host with **Mesa 26.1 or newer** — Arch/CachyOS, and rolling distros
generally — none of the variables above make any difference, including
`WEBKIT_DMABUF_RENDERER_FORCE_SHM`, `WEBKIT_SKIA_ENABLE_CPU_RENDERING`,
`EGL_PLATFORM=surfaceless` and `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=swrast`. That is
expected: the failure is in EGL **display creation**, which happens before
WebKit consults any rendering-path flag, so there is nothing left for a flag
to change.

The cause is a version pairing, not a bug in either half. The AppImage bundles
a WebKitGTK built on Ubuntu but ships no `libEGL` of its own, so that bundled
WebKit runs against *your* Mesa. On Mesa ≥ 26.1 it calls
`eglGetPlatformDisplay()` in a way the newer driver rejects. Your distro's own
WebKitGTK is fine, because it was compiled against the Mesa you are running —
which is why building from source works on the same machine.

**From v0.4.1 the AppImage handles this itself:** when your system has a
WebKitGTK at least as new as the bundled one, the launcher lets your copy take
precedence, and the bundled libraries fill in only what your system lacks.

That check reads your WebKit version from `pkg-config`, which is only installed
alongside the **development** package. If you have the runtime but not the dev
package, the launcher can't compare versions and keeps the bundled copy — so
tell it explicitly:

```bash
OMNIVOICE_PREFER_SYSTEM_WEBKIT=1 ./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
```

(Set it to `0` to force the bundled copy — useful if your distro's WebKitGTK is
older than ours and you'd rather keep the newer bundled one.)

If you are on v0.4.0 or older, either update or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio.git
cd VoiceStudio
bun install
bun run desktop-prod
```

## AppImage: "No microphone found" while the raw binary records fine

Recording from the AppImage fails with *"No microphone found. Connect or enable
a microphone and try again."* — but `pactl list short sources` shows your
microphones, `gst-launch-1.0 pulsesrc … ! fakesink` captures, and running
`frontend/src-tauri/target/debug/omnivoice-studio` directly records without
trouble. `GST_DEBUG=2` shows the real message:

```text
WARN GST_REGISTRY gst_registry_binary_check_magic:
  Binary registry magic version is different : 1.23.90 != 1.3.0
GStreamer element appsink not found. Please install it.
```

Same shape as the blank-window problem above, in a different library. The
AppImage bundles the GStreamer **core** (WebKitGTK links it) but not its
**plugins** — those are loaded dynamically at runtime, so the packaging step
cannot see them to copy. The bundled core then reads *your* plugin directory,
whose plugins were built against *your* core, the version check rejects them,
and the scan produces nothing. `appsink` is one of the elements that goes
missing, and it is the one WebKit needs to hand over a capture stream — so
`getUserMedia()` reports no device. Your raw binary works because it uses your
core with your plugins, which agree.

**From v0.4.3 the launcher prefers your system's GStreamer**, which is the only
core that can match the plugins that will actually load. It does that by
preloading that one library (`LD_PRELOAD`) rather than by putting your system
library directory ahead of the bundle — your GStreamer shares that directory
with most of the system, so hoisting it would quietly replace every *other*
bundled library too. If your distro's GStreamer is itself broken and you would
rather fall back to the bundled core:

```bash
OMNIVOICE_PREFER_SYSTEM_GSTREAMER=0 ./VoiceStudio.Studio_*.AppImage
```

The launcher checks first that your GStreamer can actually load alongside the
libraries the AppImage bundles — a system core built against newer GLib than we
ship would fail to load and take the whole app down with it, which is worse than
a missing microphone. If that check fails it prints a warning, keeps the bundled
core, and the app still starts (with capture still broken); building from source
avoids the mismatch entirely.

The AppImage also keeps its plugin-scan cache to itself, at
`~/.cache/VoiceStudio/gstreamer-registry.bin`, rather than in the shared
`~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/`. GStreamer names that shared file by architecture
alone, so two cores of different versions overwrite each other's — which both
makes this failure depend on whichever application ran last, and lets the
AppImage corrupt the cache every other GStreamer app on your machine reads.

If you set `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, the path follows it
(`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/VoiceStudio/gstreamer-registry.bin`); `~/.cache` is the default
when it is unset.

## .deb ffprobe conflict

<a id="deb-ffprobe-conflict"></a>

Pre-v0.3 `.deb` packages installed `ffprobe` into `/usr/bin/ffprobe` and
clobbered the system copy on some distros. v0.3+ relocates the bundled
binary into `/usr/lib/omnivoice-studio/bin/ffprobe` and the `postrm` script
runs `dpkg --search` to undo the old conflict on upgrade. If you upgraded
from a pre-v0.3 .deb and `ffprobe -version` now reports the wrong binary,
re-install the system package:

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall ffmpeg
```

## Restricted networks (China / Russia)

If `uv` times out fetching the python-build-standalone tarball or PyPI:

```bash
# Use a faster Python source mirror (China only — verify a current mirror)
export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download

# Use a PyPI mirror
export UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

# Or skip the download entirely if you have a compatible system Python
export UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-system

# Be tolerant of slow links
export UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=120
export UV_HTTP_RETRIES=5
```

The Phase 3 install milestone (INST-07..11) ships an OS-level mirror cascade
that picks these defaults automatically; for v0.3 set them by hand.

## AMD GPU (ROCm)

<a id="amd-gpu-rocm"></a>

ROCm support is **Linux-only and opt-in**. The **default install ships the
CUDA build** of PyTorch (the `pytorch-cuda` index in `pyproject.toml`), so on
an AMD-only machine `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False` and VoiceStudio runs
on CPU until you opt into the ROCm variant.

> **Running in Docker or Podman instead?** There's a prebuilt ROCm image —
> `ghcr.io/debpalash/omnivoice-studio:rocm` — with GPU acceleration out of the
> box; see [docker.md](docker.md#pull-and-run-amd-gpu--rocm). The rest of this
> section is about source/desktop installs. (On Windows there is no ROCm path
at all — PyTorch publishes no Windows ROCm wheels; see
[windows.md](windows.md#gpu-support).)

Three ways to opt in, in order of preference:

**1. First-run setup screen (recommended).** On Linux the setup screen's
**Compute** card offers **"AMD GPU (ROCm, Linux)"** next to the default
**Auto**. When VoiceStudio detects an AMD GPU *and* the ROCm userspace
(`/opt/rocm` present, or `rocminfo` on PATH), the ROCm option is pre-selected;
with an AMD GPU but no ROCm runtime it stays offered-but-unselected — install
ROCm first (or continue on CPU). Choosing ROCm makes the bootstrap reinstall
`torch`/`torchaudio` from the ROCm wheel index
(`https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4` by default) right after the
dependency sync — matched to the app's pinned `torch==2.8.0` (the rocm6.2
index only ever published up to torch 2.5.1, so it silently failed the
reinstall and left the CPU-only CUDA build in place).

**2. Environment variable (existing installs / headless).** Set
`OMNIVOICE_TORCH_VARIANT=rocm` before launching — the next bootstrap performs
the same ROCm reinstall. `OMNIVOICE_TORCH_INDEX=<url>` overrides the wheel
index when you need a different ROCm version — e.g. AMD publishes newer
driver-matched builds (7.2.x) at `repo.radeon.com` as a `--find-links` page
rather than a PyPI-style index:
```bash
uv pip install --reinstall torch==2.8.0 torchaudio==2.8.0 \
  --find-links https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-7.2.4/
```
run that manually if you want a specific ROCm point release; the
`OMNIVOICE_TORCH_INDEX` env var only accepts a PEP 503 index URL, not a
find-links page. If the reinstall fails (network, unsupported card), VoiceStudio
keeps the default torch build and warns instead of breaking the install.

**3. Manual wheel swap (fallback).** Replace torch with the ROCm wheel
**after** the first-run install populates the venv:

```bash
# From the project directory (source install), into VoiceStudio's uv venv.
# Matches the app's torch==2.8.0 pin — a different ROCm point release
# (e.g. rocm6.2, rocm7.x) may not carry that exact torch build.
uv pip install --reinstall torch torchaudio \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
```

Once a ROCm build of PyTorch is in the venv, detection is automatic —
`get_best_device()` returns the GPU (ROCm-built PyTorch reports through
`torch.cuda.is_available()`), and VoiceStudio auto-sets
`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` for consumer cards whose GFX ID isn't in the
official ROCm support matrix. Relaunch and the Settings → System panel should
report the GPU device instead of `cpu`. Verify the wheel sees your card:

```bash
uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

Notes:
- ROCm is exercised far less than the default CUDA/MPS/CPU paths — it works,
  but expect rough edges on consumer cards and report what you hit.
- Unsupported GFX (e.g. some consumer RDNA cards): if it still won't run, set
  `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` yourself (e.g. `export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0`)
  to the nearest supported architecture before launching.
- ZLUDA (CUDA-on-ROCm translation) can work but is unsupported here — prefer a
  native ROCm wheel.
