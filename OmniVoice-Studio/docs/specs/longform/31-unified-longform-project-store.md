# Implementation Spec — TASK #31: Unified `LongformProject` store

## TL;DR

Today there are two long-form text-to-speech editors — **Stories** (`frontend/src/components/StoriesEditor.jsx`, multi-voice cast + per-line tracks) and **Audiobook** (`frontend/src/pages/AudiobookTab.jsx`, single raw-text script + book metadata) — and they share *nothing* at the data layer. Stories has a persisted project model in `storiesSlice` (cast/tracks/projects in localStorage via the root zustand persist); Audiobook has **zero persistence** (title/author/narrator/genre/cover/lexicon/format/loudness/text all live in component `useState` at `AudiobookTab.jsx:21-48` and evaporate on tab switch or reload).

This spec introduces **one project concept** — a `LongformProject` — that both editors bind to. It carries the shared book identity (`title/author/narrator/genre/year/description` + cover + lexicon) once, alongside the structured content (cast + tracks + raw script), plus a `mode` discriminator (`'stories' | 'audiobook'`). This (a) gives Audiobook the persistence it lacks today, (b) lets a single saved project be re-opened in either editor, turning **#24 (Story ⇄ Audiobook convert)** from a data-shuttling problem into a `mode` toggle, and (c) consolidates the two divergent persistence stories into one slice with a tested localStorage migration that is backward-compatible with existing `storyProjects`.

**Scope note (the "defer until #24 reveals shape" caveat):** #24 has *not* shipped. This spec deliberately lands the **store + migration + Audiobook persistence binding** (the parts whose shape is already fully determined by the two existing editors), and defines — but does **not** implement — the `mode`-toggle/convert UI, leaving a clean seam (`convertMode`, `setProjectMode`) for #24 to consume. See PR slices: 31a/31b ship now; 31c is the #24 hand-off.

## Problem

1. **Audiobook loses everything on reload.** `AudiobookTab.jsx:21-48` holds `text` (`:21`), `defaultVoice` (`:22`), `format` (`:34`), `loudness` (`:35`), `meta` (title/author/narrator/year/genre/description, `:36-38`), `coverFile`/`coverPreview` (`:39-40`), and `lex` (pronunciation lexicon, `:42`) entirely in `useState`. Switch to another mode and back, or reload, and it's all gone. Stories users get named, persisted projects (`storiesSlice` `saveProject` `:84-100` / `loadProject` `:101-105`); Audiobook users get a blank textarea every time. This is an inconsistency users hit immediately on a 50-chapter book.

2. **Two project concepts that should be one.** A "project" in `storiesSlice.ts:28-34` is `StoryProject = {id, name, tracks, cast, updatedAt}`. An Audiobook "project" doesn't exist as a noun — but conceptually it's `{title, author, narrator, genre, …, script, lexicon, cover}`. These overlap heavily (both are "a long-form thing I'm narrating with metadata"), yet there's no shared store, so #24 (convert between them) has nowhere to read/write a unified shape.

3. **The convergence is half-built and asymmetric.** The render pipeline already converged: both editors stream through the SAME backend generator `_render_longform_sse` (`backend/api/routers/audiobook.py:345`) — Audiobook via `POST /audiobook` (`audiobook.ts:76-82` `audiobookGenerate`), Stories via `POST /longform/render` (`audiobook.ts:116-122` `longformRender`); see `StoriesEditor.jsx:360-402` `generateAll`, `utils/storyToSpans.js`. But the *project/metadata* layer did not. Stories' full export at `StoriesEditor.jsx:368-371` calls `longformRender({ chapters, format })` and **drops** `metadata`/`loudness`/`cover_path` — even though `LongformRenderBody` (`audiobook.ts:100-108`) already accepts all three — because Stories has no metadata fields to send. Audiobook *has* those fields but can't persist or reuse them. One store fixes the input side of an already-converged output side.

4. **#24 is blocked on a shape.** "Story ⇄ Audiobook convert" needs a target representation. Without a unified store, #24 would invent ad-hoc serialization between two slices/components. With it, convert is `setProjectMode('audiobook')` over the same record.

## Goal / Non-goals

### Goals
- One persisted `LongformProject` shape both editors read/write, carrying shared metadata (`title/author/narrator/genre/year/description`), cover reference, pronunciation lexicon, output prefs (`format/loudness`), the structured content (`cast`, `tracks`, `script`), and a `mode` discriminator.
- **Audiobook gains persistence**: title/author/narrator/genre/cover/lexicon/format/loudness/script/defaultVoice survive reload and tab switches, and can be saved as named projects in the same Projects list Stories uses.
- **localStorage migration** from the current persist `version: 4` shape (`storyProjects`, `storyTracks`, `cast`, `currentProjectId`) to the unified shape, with backward-compat: existing saved Stories projects open exactly as before, no data loss, no manual user migration (per the project's "backward-compatible project data" constraint).
- Leave a **named seam** (`convertMode`/mode toggle action) for #24, without implementing #24's UI.
- **Clean working-state lifecycle**: loading or starting a project leaves *no stale working state* from the prior session — every working field (tracks, cast, script, meta, lexicon, coverRef, prefs, mode) is deterministically (re)set, not partially carried over (see States & edge cases → A).

### Non-goals (explicitly deferred)
- **#24's convert UI / mode-toggle button** — not built here. We ship the store + the `convertMode` action; the toggle button and the "open this project in the other editor" UX is #24.
- **Backend changes.** `/longform/render`, `/audiobook` + `/audiobook/{plan,preview,cover,import}`, `/stories/encode` endpoints are untouched. This is a frontend store + binding change only. The SSE event vocabulary (pinned below in API/data shapes → SSE) is **read-only contract** here — neither editor's event handling changes.
- **No alembic / `omnivoice_data/` change.** LongformProject is browser localStorage state (zustand persist via `store/index.ts:55-132`), not backend DB. The "backward-compatible project data → schema change goes through alembic" constraint applies to the **Python/`omnivoice_data/` SQLite path only**; the *localStorage analog* of that same constraint (no data loss, no manual migration) is satisfied here by the **versioned lazy `migrate` fn** (zustand persist's equivalent of an alembic upgrade — see Constraints → Backward-compatible data). Confirmed: Audiobook metadata/cover are client-side only today (the only server contact is `audiobookUploadCover` → `POST /audiobook/cover`, which returns `{ path: string }`, not stored project state).
- **No change to the rendered output** of either editor — same spans, same SSE handling (`utils/sseParse.js`).
- Merging the actual editor *components* into one — they stay two components; only the store unifies. (Component merge, if ever, is downstream of #22 shared `<VoiceSelector>`.)
- Cover-file persistence as bytes. localStorage can't hold the blob; we persist only a re-uploadable reference + filename (see API/data shapes).
- **No mid-flight render survival.** An in-progress Audiobook/Stories render that is interrupted by a tab switch or reload is *abandoned*, not resumed (see States & edge cases → F). Working *project* state survives; the streaming render job does not. (Backend-job resume is `longformJobs`/server territory, out of scope.)
- **No new user-input parser / regex.** This task reads/writes the *same* script string and reuses the *existing* parsers (`parseScript`, `importStory`, `storyToSpans`) only where they're already called. It introduces **no new regex over user-pasted text** (the only new validation is membership in two literal mode strings). The ReDoS surface is therefore unchanged in 31a/31b; #24 (which *will* run `parseScript` on the script string to populate `tracks`) inherits the ReDoS-review duty — flagged in Constraints → CodeQL so #24 doesn't import it blind.

## Design

### One slice, renamed in concept: `longformSlice` (supersedes `storiesSlice`)

`frontend/src/store/storiesSlice.ts` becomes `frontend/src/store/longformSlice.ts`. The current `StoryProject` (`storiesSlice.ts:28-34`) is generalized into `LongformProject`. The currently-loose top-level working state (`storyTracks`, `cast`, `storyProjects`, `currentProjectId` — all defined in the slice init at `storiesSlice.ts:67-70`) is kept and **augmented** with the shared-metadata working fields that Audiobook needs (`meta`, `lexicon`, `outputFormat`, `loudness`, `coverRef`, `mode`, `script`, `defaultVoice`).

Key design decision — **two content representations coexist in one project**:
- `cast` + `tracks` — the Stories structured model (line cards; `StoryTrack` at `storiesSlice.ts:12-19`, `CastMember` at `:21-26`).
- `script` (string) — the Audiobook raw markdown model (`AudiobookTab.jsx:21` `text`).

A `LongformProject.mode` says which one is *authoritative* for that project. Both editors can read a project; an editor opening a project whose `mode` doesn't match it either (a) renders read-friendly via the existing converters, or (b) — the simpler v1 behavior — only the matching editor binds working state, and the **non-matching open is what #24 will turn into an explicit "convert" action**. v1 ships path (b): opening an `audiobook`-mode project from the Projects list routes to the Audiobook tab; a `stories`-mode project routes to Stories. The store already has the directional bridge #24 needs: `utils/storyToSpans.js` does stories→spans; the reverse — `scriptToTracks` via the existing `utils/parseScript.js` / `utils/importStory.js` (both already imported by `StoriesEditor.jsx:19-20`) — is a #24 deliverable.

### The working-state reset contract (completeness foundation)

Today `loadProject` (`storiesSlice.ts:101-105`) sets **only** `storyTracks`, `cast`, `currentProjectId`, and `newProject` (`:106`) sets **only** `storyTracks`, `cast`, `currentProjectId`. That was complete when the *only* working content was tracks+cast. Once we add `script`/`meta`/`lexicon`/`coverRef`/`outputFormat`/`loudness`/`defaultVoice`/`mode` as working fields, **a naive port leaks the previous session's metadata into a freshly-loaded/new project.** Both actions must therefore (re)set the *entire* working surface, every time, with no partial carry-over:

- `loadProject(id)`: restore **all** record fields into working state — `storyTracks`, `cast`, `script`, `meta`, `lexicon`, `coverRef`, `outputFormat`, `loudness`, `defaultVoice`, `mode`, `currentProjectId`. Fields absent on an older/partial record (e.g. a v4-migrated Stories project that never had `script`) fall back to the **same defaults the slice init uses** (`SLICE_DEFAULTS` below): `script: ''`, `meta: {}`, `lexicon: {}`, `coverRef: null`, `outputFormat: 'm4b'`, `loudness: 'off'`, `defaultVoice: null`, `mode: 'stories'`. Defensive copies (`.map(c => ({...c}))`, `{ ...meta }`, `{ ...lexicon }`) so editing working state never mutates the stored record (today's code already does this for tracks/cast at `:104`).
- `newProject(mode?)`: clear **all** working fields to defaults (`tracks: []`, `cast: DEFAULT_CAST.map(c=>({...c}))`, plus `SLICE_DEFAULTS`); set `mode` to the arg (default `'stories'` to preserve current no-arg behavior). `currentProjectId: null`.
- `convertMode(mode)`: flips working `mode` only; does **not** touch content, `currentProjectId`, or the stored record (placeholder — #24 fills the content transform).

To keep these three actions, the slice init, and the migrate fn in lockstep, define a single source of truth in `longformSlice.ts`:

```ts
// The non-content working defaults. Used by slice init, newProject, the
// loadProject default-fill, and (imported) the migrate fn. One source of truth.
export const SLICE_DEFAULTS = {
  script: '' as string,
  meta: {} as LongformMeta,
  lexicon: {} as Record<string, string>,
  coverRef: null as CoverRef | null,
  outputFormat: 'm4b' as 'm4b' | 'mp3',
  loudness: 'off' as 'off' | 'acx' | 'podcast',
  defaultVoice: null as string | null,
  mode: 'stories' as LongformMode,
} as const;
```

This contract is the single most important completeness invariant in the task and is asserted explicitly in the test plan (#7, #8).

### Why one slice, not a sibling slice for Audiobook
The two editors share the Projects list. `ProjectsPage` (`frontend/src/pages/Projects.jsx`) already takes a `storyProjects` prop (default `[]` at `:79`) and an `onOpenStory` callback (`:82`), iterates `storyProjects` to build story cards (`:146-160`), and is rendered from `App.jsx:1046-1056` with `storyProjects={storyProjects}` (`:1051`) and `onOpenStory={(id) => { loadStoryProject(id); setMode('stories'); }}` (`:1054`). A unified store means the existing Projects UI lists *both* kinds of projects with no new plumbing — Audiobook projects simply appear there for free.

> **Disambiguation (verified in code):** `Projects.jsx` *also* maintains a separate `longformJobs` local state (`:102`, rendered at `:198-211`) — these are completed **backend** audiobook render jobs fetched from the server, of `type: 'audiobooks'`, NOT client-side projects. Do **not** conflate `longformJobs` with the new client `longformProjects`. The renamed projects array (`storyProjects` → `longformProjects`) flows in via the existing `storyProjects` prop (rename the prop or keep the prop name + pass the new array — see Integration); `longformJobs` is untouched.

A second slice would require a second projects list, two `currentProjectId`s, and bespoke routing — the opposite of unification.

### Migration strategy (zustand persist `version` 4 → 5)
The root store's persist config (`store/index.ts:55-132`) bumps `version: 4` (`:115`) → `version: 5`, and the `migrate` function (`:120-130`) gains a `version < 5` branch that:
1. Renames nothing destructively — old keys `storyProjects`, `storyTracks`, `cast`, `currentProjectId` (persisted at `index.ts:109-113`) are **read** and mapped forward.
2. For each old `StoryProject` (`{id,name,tracks,cast,updatedAt}`), produces a `LongformProject` by spreading it over defaults: `mode: 'stories'`, `meta: {}`, `lexicon: {}`, `outputFormat: 'm4b'`, `loudness: 'off'`, `coverRef: null`, `defaultVoice: null`, `script: ''`. The spread `...sp` goes **last** so original `id/name/cast/tracks/updatedAt` always win over defaults.
3. Maps the loose working state: `storyTracks` and `cast` pass through unchanged (keep `storyTracks`/`cast` as the persisted/working key names to minimize component churn — see Working-state naming); seeds the new working metadata fields (`mode`, `meta`, `script`, `lexicon`, `coverRef`, `outputFormat`, `loudness`, `defaultVoice`) to defaults.
4. Returns the upgraded partial. The migrate fn must **never throw** — `index.ts:121` already returns `{}` for non-object input, and `:122-128` passes old shapes through (`version < 4` branch). **Upgrade > crash** is this codebase's stated migration philosophy (the comment at `index.ts:116-119`, verified verbatim: *"Drop old persisted shapes rather than crashing the app… Upgrade > crash."*); we keep it: anything missing falls through to slice init defaults.

**Migration must defend against malformed persisted data (enumerated):**
- `p.storyProjects` is **not an array** (corrupted blob, hand-edited localStorage, partial write) → `Array.isArray` guard, treat as `[]`; do not throw.
- An individual project entry is **not an object** (e.g. `null`, a string) → skip it (filter to objects) rather than spreading a non-object; never produce a `longformProjects` entry that lacks `id`/`name`.
- A project entry is **missing `tracks`/`cast`/`id`/`name`/`updatedAt`** → defaults fill them (`tracks: []`, `cast: []`, generated `id`, `name: 'Untitled'`, `updatedAt: 0`). A project with no `id` is still openable (we synthesize one) rather than silently dropped — but if `id` synthesis would collide, last-write-wins on save is acceptable (matches existing `saveProject` upsert at `:95-98`).
- `currentProjectId` points to a project that **no longer exists** post-migration (e.g. was the malformed one we skipped) → leave `currentProjectId` as-is; the load-time guard in `loadProject` (`if (!p) return`, `:103`) already no-ops harmlessly, and `currentProject` (`StoriesEditor.jsx:217`) resolves to `null` → blank working state, no crash. Optionally null it during migration; either is safe.
- `version` is `> 5` (user downgraded the app, then re-upgraded) → the function returns `persisted` unchanged via the final passthrough (`:129`); new fields already present, no double-migration.
- `version` is `< 4` → existing `version < 4` branch (`:122-128`) runs **first**, then falls through to the `version < 5` branch in the same call (ordering: handle `< 4` passthrough, then `< 5` upgrade). Confirm a v2/v3 blob (no `storyProjects` key at all) yields `longformProjects: []`, not a throw.

Backward-compat guarantee: a user on v4 with three saved Stories projects reloads → sees the same three projects, same names, same cast/tracks, `mode: 'stories'` — opens identically in Stories. Nothing prompts them. New Audiobook projects they save afterward coexist in the same list.

### Working-state naming (minimize component churn)
`StoriesEditor.jsx:115-127` binds **13 store selectors** (`storyTracks` `:115`, `setStoryTracks` `:116`, `cast` `:117`, `setCast` `:118`, `upsertCastMember` `:119`, `removeCastMember` `:120`, `setCharacterVoice` `:121`, `storyProjects` `:122`, `currentProjectId` `:123`, `saveProject` `:124`, `loadProject` `:125`, `newProject` `:126`, `deleteProject` `:127`), and `setStoryTracks` is re-wrapped at `:130-133` as `setTracks`. To keep these call sites stable, the **working content field names stay** (`storyTracks`, `cast`, `setStoryTracks`, `setCast`, `upsertCastMember`, etc., unchanged signatures from `storiesSlice.ts:71-83`). We **add** new working fields/actions for the shared metadata that Audiobook binds to. The *project record* type is renamed (`StoryProject` → `LongformProject`) and the projects array is renamed (`storyProjects` → `longformProjects`) with a deprecated alias to avoid breaking `ProjectsPage`/`App.jsx`/`StoriesEditor.jsx` in the same PR (see Integration points). This keeps the diff reviewable: Stories' line-editing code is unchanged; only project save/load gains metadata, and Audiobook gains store binding.

> **Note on `storyProjects` consumers:** a repo-wide grep confirms exactly 6 files reference `storyProjects`: `store/storiesSlice.ts`, `store/storiesSlice.test.ts`, `store/index.ts`, `components/StoriesEditor.jsx`, `pages/Projects.jsx`, `App.jsx`. All must be accounted for in the rename + alias bridge.

> **Note on the `_trackId` reseed effect (`StoriesEditor.jsx:135-140`):** Stories reseeds its module-level `_trackId` counter from the max persisted track id **once on mount** (`useEffect([], …)` — verified: dep array is `[]`, `:140`). After unification, a user who opens a *different* Stories project from the Projects page (`loadProject` while StoriesEditor is already mounted) will **not** re-trigger this effect, so a newly-added line could collide with an id from the just-loaded project. This is a **pre-existing latent bug** the load path now makes reachable. Mitigation (low-cost, in 31b): change the effect dep array to `[currentProjectId]`, or reseed inside the `setTracks` add path. Track explicitly; do not silently leave it.

## States & edge cases (COMPLETENESS)

This section enumerates every state the feature must handle and the exact behavior for each. Items A–J are load-bearing; each maps to a test or an explicit no-op-by-design.

### A. Working-state lifecycle / stale-carryover (highest risk)
- **A1. Load Stories project A (metadata set) → load Stories project B (no metadata).** B must show empty metadata, not A's. `loadProject` resets the full working surface (see reset contract). *Test #8.*
- **A2. Edit Audiobook metadata (unsaved) → `newProject()`.** New project starts with empty `meta`/`script`/`lexicon`/`coverRef`, default prefs, `mode: 'stories'`. No carry-over. *Test #7.*
- **A3. Load an `audiobook`-mode project, then load a `stories`-mode project.** Working `mode` flips `audiobook → stories`; Audiobook-only fields (`script`, `meta`, etc.) reset to the stories record's values (or defaults if absent). The matching tab (Stories) binds; the previous tab's transient render state is irrelevant (it unmounted).
- **A4. v4-migrated Stories project (no `script`/`meta` keys) loaded.** Missing keys resolve to `SLICE_DEFAULTS` via the reset contract — never `undefined` reaching a controlled `<input value={...}>` (React warns on `undefined → string` controlled-input flips). Every metadata input is bound to a guaranteed-string/object default. The six `meta.*` inputs at `AudiobookTab.jsx:274-286` each read `meta.title`/`meta.author`/etc. — all must be `''`, never `undefined`.

### B. Empty / missing / partial inputs
- **B1. Empty `name` on `saveProject('')`.** Preserve existing behavior: `name || 'Untitled'` (`storiesSlice.ts:90`) for Stories; Audiobook save reuses the same fallback. The `StoriesEditor.saveCurrent` already passes `projectName.trim() || t('stories.untitled')` (`:224`); Audiobook's new save affordance mirrors this with an audiobook-appropriate default (e.g. `meta.title || t('audiobook.untitled')` — if added as a key, propagate to all 21 locales). The **store-level** fallback (`name || 'Untitled'`) is the non-localized last-resort guard; the *displayed* default name passed in by each editor is localized via `t()` (see Constraints → Localization).
- **B2. Save an Audiobook project with empty `script` and empty `meta`.** Allowed — it persists an empty-but-named project (matches Stories allowing save of an empty cast/track set; existing test `:97-98` saves with no tracks). The record is still openable; reopening yields the blank editor.
- **B3. Empty `lexicon` rows.** `lexDict()` (`AudiobookTab.jsx:43-45`) already filters rows where `word.trim()`/`say.trim()` are blank; the store's `lexicon` should hold the **filtered dict** (`{word→say}`), but the editable UI still needs the **row array with blanks** for in-progress typing. Decision: store `lexicon` as the filtered dict (the wire/persist shape, matching `LongformProject.lexicon: Record<string,string>`); keep the *editable rows* (including blank in-progress rows) as **component-local** `useState` in AudiobookTab, hydrated from the dict on mount and flushed to the store on change. This avoids persisting half-typed `{word:'', say:''}` junk. *Edge:* a row with `word` filled but `say` blank is dropped from the persisted dict but kept in the local editing rows until the user fills `say` or removes the row. **Rehydration mapping (dict → rows):** on mount, `Object.entries(lexicon).map(([word, say]) => ({ word, say }))`; the flush direction (rows → dict) reuses the existing `lexDict()` shape exactly.
- **B4. `defaultVoice` references a profile id that no longer exists** (voice deleted between sessions). The `<select>` (`AudiobookTab.jsx:220-224`) will have no matching `<option>`, so it renders empty → falls back to engine default on render (`default_voice: defaultVoice || null`, `:132`). Acceptable; no crash. Same already true for Stories cast `profileId` (resolved by `effectiveProfile` in `storyCast.ts`).
- **B5. Stories `cast` member references a deleted profile** — unchanged from today; `storyToSpans`/`effectiveProfile` already tolerate stale `profileId` by falling back to default. Unification doesn't change this.

### C. Cover image round-trip (no bytes in localStorage)
- **C1. Pick cover → save project → reload.** `coverFile` blob is transient; on reload the live preview is gone. Persisted `coverRef = { filename, serverPath }` survives. UI shows the **filename** (and a "cover set" affordance) but not the image preview (we can't reconstruct a blob from a server path without a fetch; v1 shows filename text, not a thumbnail — keep it honest). *Test: save with cover → simulate reload → `coverRef.serverPath` survives.*
- **C2. Re-render after reload using only `coverRef.serverPath`.** `onCreate` (`AudiobookTab.jsx:121-124`) currently uploads `coverFile` and uses the returned `{ path }`. New logic: **if `coverFile` is present, upload it (fresh path) AND `setCoverRef({ filename: coverFile.name, serverPath: cover_path })`; else if `coverRef.serverPath` is present, reuse it** as `cover_path`. So a reloaded session re-renders with the persisted cover without re-picking. Exact resolution helper signature below in API/data shapes.
- **C3. `serverPath` is stale / cleaned up server-side** (the cover upload dir was a temp dir the backend garbage-collected; note `_safe_cover_path(cover_path)` at `audiobook.py:451` confines/validates the path server-side). Render either succeeds (backend ignores missing cover) or the backend errors. Behavior: the backend surfaces a generic `{type:'error', error:'render failed (see backend log)'}` SSE event (`audiobook.py:474`) which `onCreate` maps to the existing `error` channel (`AudiobookTab.jsx:165-167`); **do not crash the editor**; the user can re-pick a cover. Document that `coverRef` is best-effort — re-picking always works.
- **C4. `coverFile` upload fails** (`audiobookUploadCover` throws). Caught by the outer `try/catch` (`:170-172`); `error` is set, `generating` reset in `finally`. No partial render. Unchanged from today's behavior — just confirm the store-bound source doesn't change the error path.
- **C5. Clear cover (`clearCover`, `:57-61`)** must also null the persisted `coverRef`, not just the transient blob — otherwise a removed cover reappears (as a filename) on reload. Wire `clearCover` → also call `setCoverRef(null)`.

### D. Migration / persistence failure modes
- **D1. Corrupted / non-object persisted blob** → `migrate` returns `{}` (`index.ts:121` guard); store boots to all slice defaults. No crash. *Test #6 garbage case.*
- **D2. `storyProjects` non-array** → treated as `[]` (Array.isArray guard). *See Migration → malformed defenses.*
- **D3. Malformed individual project entries** → object-filter + default-fill; never drop silently except non-objects. *See Migration.*
- **D4. localStorage write fails (quota exceeded / private-mode).** zustand persist's `setItem` throwing is swallowed by the middleware (it logs, does not crash the app). Working state still functions in-memory for the session; it just won't survive reload. We add no new failure surface here, but the spec **acknowledges** large books (50-chapter scripts as a single `script` string + tracks) push localStorage size; quota is realistically multi-MB so a single book is fine, but a user with dozens of saved big projects could hit it. Mitigation note: no eviction policy in v1 (Stories already persists projects unbounded); flag for v0.4 if reported.
- **D5. Two app windows / tabs open simultaneously** (Tauri can have multiple webviews) both writing the persisted store → last-write-wins, standard localStorage behavior; zustand persist does not cross-tab-sync by default. No regression vs. today (Stories already has this). Out of scope to fix; note it. (Identical on macOS/Windows/Linux — not a platform divergence; see Constraints → Cross-platform parity.)
- **D6. Migration runs but `cast` working field is missing on a v4 blob that only had `storyProjects`** (user never touched the editor) → working `cast` falls through to slice init `DEFAULT_CAST` (`:68`). Confirmed safe.

### E. Routing / open-from-Projects edge cases
- **E1. Open `audiobook`-mode project from Projects list.** `onOpenStory(id)` → `loadProject(id)` → read loaded `mode` → `setMode('audiobook')` → routes to AudiobookTab (`App.jsx:1077-1082`), fields restored. *Acceptance #4.*
- **E2. Open `stories`-mode project.** → `setMode('stories')` → StoriesEditor. (Today's behavior, preserved.)
- **E3. Open a project whose `mode` is missing/unknown** (defensive). Default to `'stories'` (`rec.mode === 'audiobook' ? 'audiobook' : 'stories'`) so any non-`'audiobook'` value, including `undefined`, routes to Stories — the safe legacy default. (This two-value membership check is the *entire* new "validation" surface in the task — it is a literal-equality test, **not** a regex, so it carries no ReDoS exposure; see Constraints → CodeQL.)
- **E4. Open a project while the *other* editor is mid-render.** The other editor unmounts on `setMode`; its in-flight SSE read is abandoned (see F). The opened project's working state is set cleanly by `loadProject`. No bleed-through.
- **E5. `onOpenStory` called with an id that doesn't resolve** (deleted between list render and click). `loadProject` no-ops (`:103`); the routing logic must read the record mode **and** verify resolution *before* `setMode`. Exact `onOpenStory` body pinned in API/data shapes → Routing.

### F. In-flight render interrupted (tab switch / reload)
- **F1. Audiobook generating → user switches tab.** `AudiobookTab` unmounts; `abortRef` (component-local, `:31`) is lost, the `reader.read()` loop is abandoned when the component is GC'd, but the **fetch/SSE stream may keep running server-side** until the backend finishes or the connection drops. Working *project* state (text/meta/etc., now store-bound) survives; the render result (`output`) does **not** persist (it's transient `useState`, `:27`). On return, the user sees the restored inputs but no in-progress render — they re-click Create. **This is acceptable v1 behavior; explicitly NOT resumed.** (Resumable backend jobs = `longformJobs`, separate.)
- **F2. Stories generating (`generateAll`) → tab switch.** Same as F1; `exporting`/`exportPct` are component `useState` (`StoriesEditor.jsx:147-148`), lost on unmount. Project (tracks/cast/meta) survives via store.
- **F3. Reload during generation.** Stream dies with the page; nothing to resume. Inputs restored from persist. No "ghost generating" spinner because generation flags were never persisted (they're transient `useState`, never in `partialize`). Confirm none of the new persisted fields accidentally capture a transient (the partialize block lists *exactly* the working metadata fields, no `generating`/`output`/`progress`/`exporting`/`exportPct`). This matches the existing partialize comment at `index.ts:107-108` ("strip transient runtime fields… so a dead blob: URL / stuck spinner never rehydrates").

### G. `convertMode` seam (placeholder, #24 fills)
- **G1. `convertMode('audiobook')` on a stories project with content.** v1: flips working `mode` to `'audiobook'`, content untouched. Since AudiobookTab reads `script` (empty for a stories project), the user would see a blank script — which is exactly why the **content transform is #24's job**. v1 ships the flag flip only and routes nowhere (no UI button). *Test #2: assert `convertMode` flips `mode` and does NOT mutate `cast`/`tracks`/`script`.*
- **G2. `convertMode` to the same mode it's already in.** No-op (idempotent); does not bump `updatedAt` or touch the record. (Implementation guard: `if (get().mode === mode) return;`.)
- **G3. `convertMode` with an invalid mode value.** TypeScript prevents it at compile time; at runtime, guard to the two known modes or ignore (`if (mode !== 'stories' && mode !== 'audiobook') return;`) — do not set an unknown mode that breaks routing E3.

### H. Save/load idempotency & duplicate handling (preserve existing contract)
- **H1. Save twice with a `currentProjectId`** → in-place update, no duplicate (existing test `:73-81`, must stay green). The new metadata fields snapshot on every save, overwriting the prior record's metadata. *Test #2.*
- **H2. Save a new (no `currentProjectId`) project** → new id, appended (`:95-98`). `currentProjectId` set to the new id (`:98`).
- **H3. Delete the currently-open project** (`deleteProject`, `:107-111`) → removed; `currentProjectId` nulled if it matched. Working content is **not** cleared by delete today (only `currentProjectId`) — preserve that (the user keeps editing the now-orphaned content, can re-save as new). Note explicitly so the reset contract (A) doesn't accidentally also wipe working state on delete.
- **H4. Rename a project** (`renameProject`, `:112-113`) — unchanged; only `name` changes, never metadata.

### I. Concurrent field edits / partial patches
- **I1. `setProjectMeta({ title })` must merge, not replace.** Partial patch: `set(s => ({ meta: { ...s.meta, ...patch } }))`. Editing `title` must not clear `author`. The current `AudiobookTab.setMetaField` (`:49`) already does `{ ...m, [k]: ... }`; the store action must preserve that merge semantics, not overwrite the whole object.
- **I2. `setOutputPrefs({ loudness })`** similarly merges (`outputFormat`/`defaultVoice` untouched). Patch keys are `outputFormat | loudness | defaultVoice` (the 3 prefs), all optional; `set(s => ({ outputFormat: p.outputFormat ?? s.outputFormat, loudness: p.loudness ?? s.loudness, defaultVoice: p.defaultVoice !== undefined ? p.defaultVoice : s.defaultVoice }))` — note `defaultVoice` uses `!== undefined` because `null` is a *valid* value (engine default) that must overwrite.
- **I3. `setLexicon(dict)`** replaces the whole dict (it's the flushed editable-rows result; replacement is correct, not merge).

### J. i18n / metadata-on-the-wire edge cases
- **J1. Metadata field with only whitespace.** `onCreate` already filters `v && v.trim()` (`:127`) before sending. The store persists the *raw* (untrimmed) value the user typed; the **wire filter stays in `onCreate`**, unchanged. So persisted `meta.title = '  '` round-trips but is dropped from the request body — preserve this exactly (`AudiobookTab.jsx:126-128`).
- **J2. `loudness: 'off'` maps to `null` on the wire** (`:134`). The store holds `'off'`; the request maps it (`loudness === 'off' ? null : loudness`). Keep the mapping in `onCreate`/`generateAll`, not in the store (store holds the UI-level value, type `'off' | 'acx' | 'podcast'`; the wire type is `'off' | 'acx' | 'podcast' | null` per `AudiobookGenerateBody.loudness` `audiobook.ts:65`).
- **J3. Stories export with no metadata** (a v4-migrated project, `meta: {}`). `generateAll` filters empties identically to `onCreate`; sends `metadata: null` when empty so the wire shape is unchanged for metadata-less Stories projects. *No regression to today's `{chapters, format}` call for the empty case — `metadata`/`cover_path` are optional fields on `LongformRenderBody` (`audiobook.ts:106-107`), so omitting or sending `null` is equivalent on the wire.*
- **J4. Metadata persists raw bytes regardless of language.** `meta.title`/`author`/etc. are free-text the user types in any of the 646 supported languages (incl. CJK book titles). These are **runtime data, not hardcoded UI strings**, so they're outside the no-hardcoded-CJK rule (which governs *source literals*, not stored user values). No transform/strip on store; the value round-trips byte-for-byte. (The only normalization is the wire-side whitespace filter, J1.)

## Integration points (file:line)

| Location | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/store/storiesSlice.ts` (whole file, `:1-115`) | Rename to `longformSlice.ts`; generalize `StoryProject` (`:28-34`) → `LongformProject`; rename `StoriesSlice` (`:36-51`) → `LongformSlice`, adding `meta`, `lexicon`, `coverRef`, `outputFormat`, `loudness`, `mode`, `script`, `defaultVoice` working fields; export `SLICE_DEFAULTS` + the new types (`LongformMode`, `LongformMeta`, `CoverRef`); add `setProjectMeta` (merge I1), `setLexicon` (replace I3), `setOutputPrefs` (merge I2), `setScript`, `setCoverRef`, `convertMode` (G) actions; extend `saveProject` (`:84-100`) to snapshot all new fields, `loadProject` (`:101-105`) to **restore the full working surface with default-fill** (reset contract / A4), `newProject` (`:106`) to **clear the full surface** and accept an optional `mode`. Re-export old names (`createStoriesSlice` `:66`, `StoryProject` `:28`, `StoriesSlice` `:36`) as deprecated aliases for one PR. `DEFAULT_CAST` (`:53-55`), `genProjectId` (`:57-59`), `snapshotTracks` (`:62-64`) stay; **export `genProjectId`** so the migrate fn in `index.ts` can import it (see Migration). **No hardcoded non-English string literals introduced** (the store-level `'Untitled'` fallback is the only literal, English, last-resort — localized name comes from the caller; Constraints → Localization). |
| `frontend/src/store/index.ts:36-37` | Update import: `import type { StoriesSlice } from './storiesSlice'` / `import { createStoriesSlice } from './storiesSlice'` → `import type { LongformSlice } from './longformSlice'` / `import { createLongformSlice, genProjectId, SLICE_DEFAULTS } from './longformSlice'` (keep alias export from the slice so other importers don't break; import `genProjectId`+`SLICE_DEFAULTS` for the migrate fn). |
| `frontend/src/store/index.ts:45` | `AppStore` type: `… & StoriesSlice & …` → `… & LongformSlice & …`. |
| `frontend/src/store/index.ts:63` | `...createStoriesSlice(set, get, api)` → `...createLongformSlice(set, get, api)`. |
| `frontend/src/store/index.ts:107-113` | `partialize`: today persists `storyTracks` (stripped at `:109-110`), `cast` (`:111`), `storyProjects` (`:112`), `currentProjectId` (`:113`). Rename `storyProjects` → `longformProjects`; keep `storyTracks`/`cast`/`currentProjectId`; **add** loose working `meta`/`script`/`lexicon`/`coverRef`/`outputFormat`/`loudness`/`defaultVoice`/`mode` so an unsaved Audiobook session survives reload — matching how `storyTracks` is already persisted loose (`:109`). Keep the existing transient strip on `storyTracks` (`:109-110`). **Do NOT persist any transient render flag** (no `generating`/`output`/`progress`/`exporting`/`exportPct` — they live in component `useState`, not the slice; confirm none sneak in) so no ghost-spinner on reload (F3). Exact partialize block diff pinned in API/data shapes → partialize. |
| `frontend/src/store/index.ts:115` | `version: 4` → `version: 5`. |
| `frontend/src/store/index.ts:120-130` | Add a `version < 5` branch in `migrate` (after the existing `version < 4` branch at `:122-128`); see Design → Migration **and** the malformed-data defenses (D1–D6). Keep the non-object guard at `:121` and the final passthrough at `:129`. Ensure `version < 4` blobs flow through the `< 4` branch *then* the `< 5` branch in the same call. Full migrate fn body pinned in API/data shapes → Migration. **This `migrate` fn IS the localStorage analog of an alembic upgrade** — Test #3 is the data-integrity gate. |
| `frontend/src/pages/AudiobookTab.jsx:21-48` | Replace local `useState` for `text` (`:21`), `defaultVoice` (`:22`), `format` (`:34`), `loudness` (`:35`), `meta` (`:36-38`) with `useAppStore` bindings (selectors pinned in API/data shapes → component binding). **Lexicon stays partially local (B3):** the editable *rows* array (with in-progress blanks) is component-local `useState`, hydrated from store `lexicon` on mount, flushed to store via `setLexicon(lexDict())` on change. Cover stays partially local: `coverFile`/`coverPreview` blob (`:39-40`) is transient (matches the `URL.revokeObjectURL` cleanup at `:57-64`); the persisted *reference* is the new `coverRef` (filename + server path). `clearCover` (`:57-61`) must also `setCoverRef(null)` (C5). The `lexDict()` helper (`:43-45`) and `setMetaField`/`setLexRow`/`addLexRow`/`removeLexRow` (`:46-49`) adapt to read/write the store (meta via `setProjectMeta` merge, lexicon via local-rows→`setLexicon`). The `format`/`loudness` `onChange` handlers (`:231`, `:239`) route through `setOutputPrefs`. **All new/changed user-facing strings via `t()` only** — no hardcoded labels; this file is **not** on the CJK-test allowlist, so any non-English literal here would fail CI (Constraints → Localization). |
| `frontend/src/pages/AudiobookTab.jsx:113-175` (`onCreate`) | Read `meta`/`lexicon`/`format`/`loudness`/`text`/`defaultVoice` from store instead of local state. The `audiobookGenerate` body construction (`:130-138`) is **unchanged in shape** — only the *source* of each field moves to the store; keep the wire transforms in place (whitespace-filter J1, `loudness→null` J2). **Cover logic (C2):** `cover_path = coverFile ? (await audiobookUploadCover(coverFile)).path : (coverRef?.serverPath ?? null)` — and on a fresh upload, `setCoverRef({ filename: coverFile.name, serverPath: cover_path })`. Keep the upload-failure path (C4) intact via the existing `try/catch` (`:170-172`). All requests stay local (`/audiobook/*`); no new external endpoint (Constraints → Local-first). SSE event handling (`:151-167`) unchanged — same event vocabulary (API/data shapes → SSE). |
| `frontend/src/pages/AudiobookTab.jsx:80-95, :97-111` (`onImport`, `onPreviewChapter`) | These set/read `text`/`defaultVoice`/`lex` (`:87-88`, `:101-104`); update to read/write the store-bound equivalents. `onImport` sets store `script` (was `setText(r.text)`, `:88`) and clears `plan` (transient, stays local). `onPreviewChapter` reads store `text`/`defaultVoice` + computed lexicon dict; the `audiobookPreviewChapter` body shape (`audiobook.ts:40`: `{text, chapter_index, default_voice, lexicon}`) is unchanged. |
| `frontend/src/components/StoriesEditor.jsx:115-127` | Store-binding selectors. `storyProjects` (`:122`) → select `longformProjects` (via alias or renamed selector). The other 12 selectors (`:115-121`, `:123-127`) stay by name. `currentProject` computed at `:217` and the projects panel render follow the rename. (This file IS on the CJK allowlist — line-editing code may keep its existing functional CJK; no *new* hardcoded UI CJK should be added regardless.) |
| `frontend/src/components/StoriesEditor.jsx:135-140` (`_trackId` reseed) | The mount-only reseed effect (dep array `[]` at `:140`) doesn't re-run on cross-session `loadProject` (latent collision bug now reachable). Change dep array to `[currentProjectId]` or reseed in the add path. See Working-state naming note. |
| `frontend/src/components/StoriesEditor.jsx:360-402` (`generateAll`) | **Now can attach metadata**: currently `:368-371` passes only `{ chapters, format }` to `longformRender`. Extend to pass `metadata`/`loudness`/`cover_path` from the unified project — `LongformRenderBody` (`audiobook.ts:100-108`) already accepts all three. Apply the **same empty-filter** as `onCreate` so a metadata-less Stories project still sends `metadata: null` (J3 — no wire regression). Map `loudness: 'off' → null`, reuse `coverRef.serverPath` if present. Exact extended body pinned in API/data shapes → Stories export. This is the immediate payoff of unification — Stories full export stops dropping book metadata. (Note: chapter-level `speed` is **not** a `LongformRenderBody.chapters[]` field; `speed` rides at span level only — `LongformRenderBody.chapters[].spans[].speed?` at `audiobook.ts:101`, set by `storyToSpans.js:40,47`.) SSE event handling (`:383-391`) unchanged. |
| `frontend/src/App.jsx:251-252` | `const storyProjects = useAppStore(s => s.storyProjects)` (`:251`) → select `longformProjects`; `const loadStoryProject = useAppStore(s => s.loadProject)` (`:252`) — `loadProject` now also sets working `mode` from the record. |
| `frontend/src/App.jsx:1046-1056` (`ProjectsPage` render) | `storyProjects={storyProjects}` (`:1051`) passes the renamed array (keep the `storyProjects` *prop name* on `Projects.jsx` OR rename it there too — pick one and apply consistently). Make `onOpenStory` (`:1054`) **mode-aware AND load-result-aware (E5)** — exact body pinned in API/data shapes → Routing. `setMode` is the store action selected at `App.jsx:110`. Routing behaves identically on macOS/Windows/Linux (no platform branch). |
| `frontend/src/pages/Projects.jsx:79, :146-160, :228` | If renaming the prop: `storyProjects = []` (`:79`) → `longformProjects = []`; the iteration at `:146-160` and the `useMemo` dep at `:228` follow. Story cards (`type:'stories'`, `:150`) can optionally branch icon/label on `sp.mode` (e.g. `BookMarked` for audiobook vs `BookOpen` for stories, mirroring the existing `:157` icon). **Subtitle for audiobook-mode projects** (`:153-154` currently builds `[story_lines, story_voices].filter(Boolean).join(' · ')`) should show a sensible audiobook summary (e.g. char count from `script.length` or a chapter hint) or fall back gracefully when `tracks`/`cast` are empty — don't render an empty subtitle for an audiobook. Any new card label/subtitle text via `t()` (Constraints → Localization). Leave `longformJobs` (`:102, :198-211`) untouched. |
| `frontend/src/store/storiesSlice.test.ts` | Rename to `longformSlice.test.ts`; keep all existing assertions green (they're the backward-compat contract — `:16-114`); add new-field tests. The test harness (`:4-10`) calls `createStoriesSlice` directly (`:8`) and reads `storyTracks`/`cast`/`storyProjects`/`currentProjectId` — keep those names working via aliases. (Test files `*.test.ts` are **excluded from CodeQL** by `security.yml:102-105` and from the CJK source scan by the test-fixture exemption in `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py:90-94` — so the ported suite carries no SAST/CJK burden.) |
| `frontend/src/i18n/locales/*.json` (**21 files**: ar, de, en, es, fr, hi, id, it, ja, ko, nl, pl, pt, ru, sv, th, tr, uk, vi, zh-CN, zh-TW — count verified: `ls locales/ \| wc -l` = 21) | No *new* user-facing strings strictly required for 31a/31b core — reuse existing keys: Audiobook keys live under `audiobook.*` (en.json `:112` block); Stories keys under `stories.*` (en.json `:26` block: `untitled:54`, `projectSaved:58`); Projects card keys under `projects.*` (`untitled_story`, `story_lines`, `story_voices` — used at `Projects.jsx:152-154`). **New keys (each × 21 locales) if 31b adds the affordances:** an Audiobook "Save project" button label + "Saved" toast (`audiobook.save_project`, `audiobook.project_saved`), an `audiobook.untitled` default name (B1), and optionally a "cover set: {filename}" label for the reloaded-cover state (C1). Each must go through `t()` and into **all 21** locales in the **same PR** (Docs-sync + Localization hard rules); a key present in `en.json` but missing in the other 20 is a CI/UX failure, not a follow-up. |

## API / data shapes

> Everything below is **frontend localStorage + in-memory** state plus **existing** backend request/response shapes the editors already speak. No backend DB schema, no alembic migration, no new endpoint. The single "schema migration" is the zustand-persist `version: 4 → 5` `migrate` fn (the localStorage analog of an alembic upgrade), pinned in full below.

### `LongformProject` (persisted record)
```ts
export type LongformMode = 'stories' | 'audiobook';

export interface LongformMeta {
  title?: string;
  author?: string;
  narrator?: string;
  year?: string;
  genre?: string;
  description?: string;
}
// Mirrors api/audiobook.ts:51-58 AudiobookMetadata EXACTLY (same 6 optional
// string fields) — keep them in lockstep, or alias `LongformMeta = AudiobookMetadata`,
// so generateAll/onCreate need no mapping.
// Values are free-text in ANY of the 646 supported languages (incl. CJK book
// titles) — this is runtime user DATA, not a hardcoded source string, so it is
// outside the no-hardcoded-CJK rule (J4). Stored byte-for-byte; no transform.

// A re-uploadable cover reference. localStorage cannot hold the File/blob
// (AudiobookTab.jsx:39-40 coverFile/coverPreview), so we persist the filename +
// the server-side path returned by audiobookUploadCover() (api/audiobook.ts:85-90,
// returns { path: string }) once uploaded. The live blob preview is rebuilt at
// render time / re-picked by the user. serverPath is BEST-EFFORT (C3): the server
// may GC the temp cover, and `_safe_cover_path` (audiobook.py:451) validates it;
// on a missing/invalid path the render surfaces a generic backend error SSE event
// and the user re-picks. Re-picking (coverFile present) always wins over serverPath
// (C2). serverPath references a LOCAL backend path (POST /audiobook/cover) — no cloud.
export interface CoverRef {
  filename: string | null;   // original picked filename, for display
  serverPath: string | null; // `path` from POST /audiobook/cover, reusable as cover_path
}

export interface LongformProject {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  mode: LongformMode;          // which content model is authoritative
  // Stories content (multi-voice):
  cast: CastMember[];          // existing CastMember (storiesSlice.ts:21-26), unchanged
  tracks: StoryTrack[];        // existing StoryTrack (storiesSlice.ts:12-19), unchanged
  // Audiobook content (raw script):
  script: string;
  // Shared book identity + output prefs:
  meta: LongformMeta;
  lexicon: Record<string, string>;     // { word -> respelling } (filtered dict; AudiobookTab.jsx:43-45)
  coverRef: CoverRef | null;
  outputFormat: 'm4b' | 'mp3';
  loudness: 'off' | 'acx' | 'podcast'; // UI-level value; 'off' maps to null on the wire (J2)
  defaultVoice: string | null;         // Audiobook's default_voice (AudiobookTab.jsx:22)
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

Concrete persisted-record example (a saved Audiobook-mode project, as it lives inside `omnivoice.app` localStorage → `state.longformProjects[0]`):
```json
{
  "id": "p_4f9ab2c1",
  "name": "The Hollow Crown",
  "mode": "audiobook",
  "cast": [],
  "tracks": [],
  "script": "# Chapter 1\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night...",
  "meta": { "title": "The Hollow Crown", "author": "J. Vex", "narrator": "Sam Reed", "year": "2026", "genre": "Fantasy", "description": "" },
  "lexicon": { "Cthylla": "THIGH-lah" },
  "coverRef": { "filename": "cover.png", "serverPath": "/abs/path/omnivoice_data/covers/abc123.png" },
  "outputFormat": "m4b",
  "loudness": "acx",
  "defaultVoice": "voice_77",
  "updatedAt": 1749800000000
}
```

### `StoryTrack` / `CastMember` (reused unchanged — verified `storiesSlice.ts:12-26`)
```ts
export interface StoryTrack {
  id: number;
  character: string;        // CastMember.id
  text: string;
  profileId: string | null; // per-line voice override (else inherits cast)
  emotion: string | null;   // per-line tone/instruct
  speed: number | null;     // per-line speed override
}
export interface CastMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color: string;
  profileId: string | null;
}
```

### `LongformSlice` (working state + action signatures)
```ts
export interface LongformSlice {
  // --- working content (names preserved from storiesSlice for low churn) ---
  storyTracks: StoryTrack[];           // Stories working tracks (storiesSlice.ts:37,67) unchanged
  cast: CastMember[];                  // unchanged (storiesSlice.ts:38,68)
  // --- new shared working metadata (Audiobook binds here) ---
  script: string;
  meta: LongformMeta;
  lexicon: Record<string, string>;     // filtered dict; AudiobookTab keeps editable rows local (B3)
  coverRef: CoverRef | null;
  outputFormat: 'm4b' | 'mp3';
  loudness: 'off' | 'acx' | 'podcast';
  defaultVoice: string | null;
  mode: LongformMode;                  // mode of the working project
  // --- projects ---
  longformProjects: LongformProject[]; // was storyProjects (storiesSlice.ts:39,69)
  currentProjectId: string | null;     // unchanged (storiesSlice.ts:40,70)

  // --- existing actions (UNCHANGED signatures, storiesSlice.ts:71-83) ---
  setStoryTracks: (tracks: StoryTrack[]) => void;
  setCast: (cast: CastMember[]) => void;
  upsertCastMember: (member: CastMember) => void;
  removeCastMember: (id: string) => void;
  setCharacterVoice: (castId: string, profileId: string | null) => void;

  // --- new working-state actions ---
  setScript: (s: string) => void;                                  // set({ script: s })
  setProjectMeta: (patch: Partial<LongformMeta>) => void;          // MERGE (I1): set(s => ({ meta: { ...s.meta, ...patch } }))
  setLexicon: (lex: Record<string, string>) => void;              // REPLACE whole dict (I3)
  setCoverRef: (ref: CoverRef | null) => void;                    // clearCover calls setCoverRef(null) (C5)
  setOutputPrefs: (
    p: { outputFormat?: 'm4b' | 'mp3'; loudness?: 'off' | 'acx' | 'podcast'; defaultVoice?: string | null }
  ) => void;                                                       // MERGE (I2); defaultVoice uses `!== undefined` (null is valid)

  // --- project lifecycle (extended to round-trip ALL new fields; existing :84-113) ---
  saveProject: (name: string) => void;        // snapshots full surface; name||'Untitled' (B1); upsert by currentProjectId (H1/H2)
  loadProject: (id: string) => void;          // RESETS full working surface + mode, default-fills missing via SLICE_DEFAULTS (A/A4); no-op if id missing (E5)
  newProject: (mode?: LongformMode) => void;  // CLEARS full surface to defaults; mode defaults to 'stories' (A2)
  deleteProject: (id: string) => void;        // unchanged (:107-111): removes + nulls currentProjectId; does NOT clear working content (H3)
  renameProject: (id: string, name: string) => void; // unchanged (:112-113); name only

  // --- seam for #24 (defined, NOT wired to UI here) ---
  convertMode: (mode: LongformMode) => void;  // flips working `mode` only; idempotent no-op if same (G2); invalid-value guard (G3); content untouched; #24 fills transform
}
```

Exact action bodies for the load-bearing three (the reset contract):
```ts
saveProject: (name) => set((s) => {
  const id = s.currentProjectId || genProjectId();
  const ts = (() => { try { return Date.now(); } catch { return 0; } })();
  const proj: LongformProject = {
    id,
    name: name || 'Untitled',
    mode: s.mode,
    cast: s.cast.map((c) => ({ ...c })),
    tracks: snapshotTracks(s.storyTracks),
    script: s.script,
    meta: { ...s.meta },
    lexicon: { ...s.lexicon },
    coverRef: s.coverRef ? { ...s.coverRef } : null,
    outputFormat: s.outputFormat,
    loudness: s.loudness,
    defaultVoice: s.defaultVoice,
    updatedAt: ts,
  };
  const exists = s.longformProjects.some((p) => p.id === id);
  return {
    longformProjects: exists
      ? s.longformProjects.map((p) => (p.id === id ? proj : p))
      : [...s.longformProjects, proj],
    currentProjectId: id,
  };
}),

loadProject: (id) => {
  const p = get().longformProjects.find((x) => x.id === id);
  if (!p) return;                         // E5: no-op when id missing
  set({

### `AudiobookTab` store binding (replaces `useState`)
```ts
// was: const [text, setText] = useState('');                    (AudiobookTab.jsx:21)
const text         = useAppStore((s) => s.script);
const setText      = useAppStore((s) => s.setScript);
// was: const [defaultVoice, setDefaultVoice] = useState('');     (:22)
const defaultVoice = useAppStore((s) => s.defaultVoice) ?? '';   // select coerces null→'' for the <select value>
// was: const [format, setFormat] = useState('m4b');             (:34)
const format       = useAppStore((s) => s.outputFormat);

// meta<input value> guards (A4): every value reads `meta.title ?? ''`, never bare `meta.title`,

```

### `audiobookGenerate` request body — UNCHANGED shape, sources moved to store (`onCreate`, `:130-138`)
```ts
// cover_path resolution (C2):
const cover_path = coverFile
  ? (await audiobookUploadCover(coverFile)).path     // returns { path: string } (audiobook.ts:85-90)
  : (coverRef?.serverPath ?? null);
if (coverFile) setCoverRef({ filename: coverFile.name, serverPath: cover_path });

const metadata = Object.fromEntries(                  // J1 whitespace filter (unchanged, :126-128)
  Object.entries(meta).filter(([, v]) => v && v.trim()));
const lexicon = lexDict();                            // filtered dict (B3)

await audiobookGenerate({                             // AudiobookGenerateBody, audiobook.ts:60-69

  metadata: Object.keys(metadata).length ? metadata : null,
  lexicon: Object.keys(lexicon).length ? lexicon : null,
});
// `bitrate` is omitted (optional, audiobook.ts:63) — unchanged from today.
```

### `longformRender` request body — Stories export, EXTENDED (`generateAll`, `:368-371`)
```ts
// today (:368-371): longformRender({ chapters, format })  — DROPS metadata/loudness/cover_path
const meta     = useAppStore.getState().meta;
const loudness = useAppStore.getState().loudness;
const coverRef = useAppStore.getState().coverRef;
const metadata = Object.fromEntries(                   // same empty-filter as onCreate (J3)
  Object.entries(meta).filter(([, v]) => v && v.trim()));

await longformRender({                                 // LongformRenderBody, audiobook.ts:100-108
  chapters,                                            // from storyToSpans(usable, cast) (:363)

  cover_path: coverRef?.serverPath ?? null,            // NEW (C2)
  metadata: Object.keys(metadata).length ? metadata : null,  // NEW (J3: null when empty → no wire regression)
});
// NOTE: chapter-level `speed` is NOT a LongformRenderBody.chapters[] field; speed
// rides at span level only (LongformRenderBody.chapters[].spans[].speed?, audiobook.ts:101).
```

### SSE event vocabulary (read-only contract — both editors, UNCHANGED)
Both `POST /audiobook` and `POST /longform/render` stream through the **same** backend generator `_render_longform_sse` (`backend/api/routers/audiobook.py:345`), so the event types are identical. Each frame is a `data: <json>\n\n` line; parsed by `parseSSELine` (`sseParse.js:29`). Verified emit sites in `audiobook.py:386-474`:

```ts
type LongformSSEEvent =
  | { type: 'started';       job_id: string; chapters: number }                 // :412
  | { type: 'chapter';       index: number; total: number; title: string;       // :430
      duration_s: number; cached: boolean }
  | { type: 'chapter_error'; index: number; total: number; title: string;       // :424
      error: string }
  | { type: 'assembling' }                                                       // :438
  | { type: 'done';          output: string; chapters: number; duration_s: number; // :463-465
      cached_chapters: number; failed_chapters: number[] }
  | { type: 'error';         error: string };                                    // :386,:390,:435,:474
```
- `AudiobookTab.onCreate` consumes `started`→`progress.total`, `chapter`/`chapter_error`→`progress.current`, `assembling`→`progress.assembling`, `done`→`output`+`{cached_chapters, failed_chapters}`, `error`→`error` channel (`:151-167`). **Unchanged.**
- `StoriesEditor.generateAll` consumes `started`→`total`, `chapter`/`chapter_error`→`exportPct`, `done`→`output`, `error`→`throw` (`:383-391`). **Unchanged.**
- `output` is a filename under `OUTPUTS_DIR` (`audiobook.py:446-447`, e.g. `audiobooks_p_xxx.m4b`), served via `audioUrl(output)` (`AudiobookTab.jsx:342`; `generate.ts` `audioUrl`). Not a project field — transient render result, never persisted (F1).

### Deprecated aliases (one-PR bridge)
```ts
export type StoryProject = LongformProject;            // alias for storiesSlice.ts:28
export const createStoriesSlice = createLongformSlice; // alias for storiesSlice.ts:66
export type StoriesSlice = LongformSlice;              // alias for storiesSlice.ts:36
// NOTE: the working-state field `storyProjects` was renamed to `longformProjects`.
// Either (a) keep a `storyProjects` getter alias in the slice, or (b) update all 6
// consumer files in the same PR. The test harness (storiesSlice.test.ts) reads
// `.storyProjects` directly (test :19,:67,:79,:103), so (a) is the lowest-churn
// bridge for one PR. (Getter alias: in createLongformSlice return, add
// `get storyProjects() { return get().longformProjects; }` is NOT possible in a
// plain object literal across set/get — instead provide a derived selector OR
// keep `storyProjects` as a duplicated key kept in sync; simplest one-PR path is
// (b): rename in all 6 files + port the test to `.longformProjects`.)
```

### `partialize` block (exact diff vs `index.ts:107-113`)
```ts
// Stories/Longform Editor — persist the project; strip transient runtime fields
// (generating, audioUrl) so a dead blob: URL / stuck spinner never rehydrates.
storyTracks:   s.storyTracks.map(({ id, character, text, profileId, emotion, speed }) =>
                  ({ id, character, text, profileId, emotion, speed })),  // UNCHANGED (:109-110)
cast:             s.cast,                  // UNCHANGED (:111)
longformProjects: s.longformProjects,      // RENAMED from storyProjects (:112)
currentProjectId: s.currentProjectId,      // UNCHANGED (:113)
// NEW loose working fields (unsaved Audiobook session survives reload, F3-safe):
script:           s.script,
meta:             s.meta,
lexicon:          s.lexicon,
coverRef:         s.coverRef,
outputFormat:     s.outputFormat,
loudness:         s.loudness,
defaultVoice:     s.defaultVoice,
mode:             s.mode,
// DO NOT add: generating/output/progress/exporting/exportPct — they are component
// useState (AudiobookTab.jsx:25-30, StoriesEditor.jsx:147-148), not slice fields.
```

### Migration (v4 → v5), FULL `migrate` fn body (replaces `index.ts:120-130`)
```ts
migrate: (persisted, version) => {
  if (!persisted || typeof persisted !== 'object') return {} as Partial<AppStore>; // existing :121 (D1)
  let p = persisted as any;
  if (version < 4) {
    // existing v1→v4 passthrough (:122-128) — all old keys have slice defaults.
    // No transform needed; fall through to the < 5 branch below in the same call.
  }
  if (version < 5) {
    const rawProjects = Array.isArray(p.storyProjects) ? p.storyProjects : [];     // (D2)
    p.longformProjects = rawProjects
      .filter((sp: any) => sp && typeof sp === 'object')                            // (D3) drop non-objects
      .map((sp: any) => ({
        // defaults FIRST…
        id: genProjectId(), name: 'Untitled', mode: 'stories',
        cast: [], tracks: [], script: '', meta: {}, lexicon: {},
        coverRef: null, outputFormat: 'm4b', loudness: 'off',
        defaultVoice: null, updatedAt: 0,
        // …then real fields win (spread LAST): id/name/cast/tracks/updatedAt
        ...sp,
      }));
    delete p.storyProjects;
    // Loose working fields seed to defaults; storyTracks/cast pass through (D6).
    p.mode = 'stories';
    // script/meta/lexicon/coverRef/outputFormat/loudness/defaultVoice are absent →
    // they fall through to slice-init SLICE_DEFAULTS on store creation (no need to
    // set them here; the slice supplies them). currentProjectId left as-is — a
    // dangling id is harmless: loadProject(:103) + currentProject(:217) no-op (E5).
    return p as Partial<AppStore>;
  }
  return p as Partial<AppStore>; // existing :129 — also covers version > 5 (downgrade-then-upgrade)
}
```
> `genProjectId` is imported from `longformSlice.ts` into `index.ts` (Integration → `index.ts:36-37`). **No user-input regex anywhere in this fn** — only `typeof`/`Array.isArray`/object-spread/`delete` (so the migrate carries no `js/redos` exposure; Constraints → CodeQL).

### `onOpenStory` routing (App.jsx:1054 — exact body, E1–E5)
```ts
onOpenStory={(id) => {
  const rec = useAppStore.getState().longformProjects.find((x) => x.id === id);
  if (!rec) return;                                  // E5: id no longer resolves → stay on Projects
  loadStoryProject(id);                              // = loadProject(id); sets working mode from rec
  setMode(rec.mode === 'audiobook' ? 'audiobook' : 'stories');  // E1/E2/E3 default-safe
}}
```

### Persisted-blob shape (whole `omnivoice.app` localStorage value)
```jsonc
// localStorage["omnivoice.app"] = { state: {...}, version: 5 }
// v5 `state` (relevant slice keys only — other slices' keys unchanged):
{
  "state": {
    "storyTracks": [ /* StoryTrack[] working */ ],
    "cast": [ { "id": "narrator", "name": "Narrator", "color": "#fabd2f", "profileId": null } ],
    "longformProjects": [ /* LongformProject[] — see record example above */ ],
    "currentProjectId": "p_4f9ab2c1",
    "script": "",
    "meta": {},
    "lexicon": {},
    "coverRef": null,
    "outputFormat": "m4b",
    "loudness": "off",
    "defaultVoice": null,
    "mode": "stories"
    // … plus all other slices' persisted keys (translateQuality, etc.)
  },
  "version": 5
}
```

## Test plan

All frontend tests run via `bunx vitest run` (package.json script `"test": "vitest run"` at `frontend/package.json:14`; `vitest ^4.1.5` at `:75`). Per MEMORY: the local loop must include `bunx vitest run`. pytest is irrelevant here — no backend change — **except** the project-wide `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py` gate (runs in CI), which scans git-tracked `.jsx`/`.ts` source: the renamed `longformSlice.ts` and modified `AudiobookTab.jsx` are scanned (not allowlisted), so the local loop should also include a quick CJK self-check on changed files before push (see Constraints → Localization).

1. **`longformSlice.test.ts` — backward-compat (must stay green):** the entire existing `storiesSlice.test.ts` suite (`:16-114` — two `describe` blocks: `storiesSlice` `:16-60`, `storiesSlice — projects` `:62-114`) ported verbatim against the renamed slice. The harness (`:4-10`) and `track()` helper (`:12-14`) carry over (rename `createStoriesSlice` import → `createLongformSlice`, and `.storyProjects` reads → `.longformProjects` if not aliased). Proves cast/track/project behavior is unchanged. Specifically the transient-strip test (`:107-113`) and the in-place-update test (`:73-81`) are load-bearing.
2. **New project-shape tests:**
   - `saveProject` snapshots `meta`, `lexicon`, `script`, `coverRef`, `outputFormat`, `loudness`, `defaultVoice`, `mode` into the record (extends the existing snapshot test at `:63-71`). Assert the exact saved-record shape matches `LongformProject` (every field present).
   - Saving twice with `currentProjectId` updates metadata in place, no duplicate (H1) — `longformProjects.length === 1` after two saves with mutated `meta`.
   - `loadProject` restores all of the above into working state *and* sets working `mode` from the record (extends `:83-94`).
   - `newProject('audiobook')` seeds `mode==='audiobook'` + blank working surface; `newProject()` defaults to `'stories'` and clears tracks/cast (preserve the no-arg behavior of `:106`).
   - transient track-field stripping still holds (port of `:107-113`; `snapshotTracks` at `storiesSlice.ts:62-64`).
   - `convertMode('audiobook')` flips working `mode` without mutating `cast`/`tracks`/`script` (G1); `convertMode` to the current mode is a no-op (G2); `convertMode('bogus' as any)` is ignored (G3).
   - `setProjectMeta({title})` merges (does not clear `author`) (I1); `setOutputPrefs({loudness})` merges (`outputFormat`/`defaultVoice` untouched) (I2); `setOutputPrefs({defaultVoice: null})` overwrites to `null` (the `!== undefined` rule); `setLexicon(dict)` replaces (I3).
3. **Migration test (the load-bearing one — the localStorage "alembic upgrade" gate):** construct a v4 persisted blob `{ storyProjects: [{id:'x',name:'A',tracks:[...],cast:[...],updatedAt:1}], storyTracks, cast, currentProjectId:'x' }`, run the `migrate` fn with `version=4`, assert: `longformProjects[0]` has the original `id/name/cast/tracks/updatedAt` plus `mode:'stories'` + metadata defaults (`script:''`, `meta:{}`, `lexicon:{}`, `coverRef:null`, `outputFormat:'m4b'`, `loudness:'off'`, `defaultVoice:null`); `storyProjects` is gone; no throw. **Malformed-input cases (D1–D6, each asserts no-throw):**
   - non-object `persisted` (string / null / number) → `{}`.
   - `storyProjects` not an array (an object / string) → `longformProjects: []`.
   - `storyProjects` array containing `null` / a string / `{}` → non-objects dropped; the `{}` entry gets a synthesized `id` (truthy `p_…`) + `name:'Untitled'` + default content.
   - a v2/v3 blob with **no** `storyProjects` key → `longformProjects: []`.
   - `version: 6` blob → returned unchanged (no re-migration; `longformProjects` left as-is).
   - `currentProjectId` pointing to a now-missing project → no throw; a later `loadProject(id)` no-ops.
   - Note: `migrate` is defined inline in the persist config (`index.ts:120-130`) — extract it to a named export (e.g. `migrateAppStore`) or test via a re-created store to exercise it.
4. **AudiobookTab persistence test (component or store-level):** set `meta.title`, switch mode away and back (simulate by re-reading store) → title persists. Assert `audiobookGenerate` is still called with the **exact body shape** of `AudiobookGenerateBody` (`text`/`default_voice`/`format`/`loudness`/`cover_path`/`metadata`/`lexicon`) — only the *source* of each field changed. Assert the whitespace-only-meta field is dropped from the wire body (J1), `loudness:'off'→null` (J2), and a CJK `meta.title` round-trips byte-for-byte through the store (J4).
5. **Stories export carries metadata:** assert `generateAll` (`StoriesEditor.jsx:360-402`) now passes `metadata`/`loudness`/`cover_path` to `longformRender` (matching the extended body above) when the project has them (regression guard that unification wired the payoff; today `:368-371` passes only `chapters`+`format`). Also assert a **metadata-less** Stories project still sends `metadata: null` (J3 — no wire regression). Assert `chapters[]` carries no top-level `speed` (span-level only).
6. **Garbage/guard suite:** covered under (3). Plus: a v4 blob whose persisted store has `cast` missing → working `cast` falls to `DEFAULT_CAST` (D6).
7. **Stale-carryover test (A — the lifecycle invariant):** save Stories project A with `meta.title='A-title'`, save Stories project B with empty meta; `loadProject(A)` then `loadProject(B)` → working `meta.title` is `''` (not `'A-title'`); same for `script`/`lexicon`/`coverRef`/prefs (A1). `newProject()` after an edited session → all working fields at `SLICE_DEFAULTS` (A2). Loading a v4-migrated project (no `script`/`meta` keys) → working fields are defaults, never `undefined` (A4).
8. **Cover round-trip test:** save with `coverRef={filename,serverPath}` → simulate reload (re-create store from persisted) → `coverRef` survives; assert `clearCover` path nulls `coverRef` (C5); assert the cover-path resolution reuses `coverRef.serverPath` when `coverFile` is null and prefers `coverFile` upload when present (C2 — unit-test the resolution expression).
9. **`bunx vitest run` full suite** stays green (existing storyToSpans / storyExport / storyCast / importStory / sseParse tests untouched but must pass).
10. **CJK source-literal gate (CI, project-wide):** `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py::test_no_hardcoded_cjk_outside_locales` must stay green after the rename — confirm `frontend/src/store/longformSlice.ts` and `frontend/src/pages/AudiobookTab.jsx` contain **no** hardcoded CJK source literals (neither file is on `_ALLOWED_FILES`; `StoriesEditor.jsx` already is, for its existing functional CJK). Run it in the local loop before push (`uv run pytest tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py -q`), not just rely on CI.

## Constraints (from CLAUDE.md)

Each relevant hard rule, and exactly how this task satisfies it:

- **Backward-compatible project data (no manual migration; DB→alembic / localStorage→versioned `migrate`).** Existing `storyProjects` in localStorage (persisted at `index.ts:112`, persist `version: 4`) must keep working with zero user action. **No `omnivoice_data/` SQLite / alembic touched** — this state is browser localStorage, so the alembic clause does not literally apply; its *intent* (versioned, tested, lossless upgrade with no manual step) is satisfied by zustand-persist's `version`-bump + lazy `migrate` fn — the localStorage analog of an alembic upgrade. Bump `version: 4 → 5` (`index.ts:115`), add a `version < 5` branch (`:120-130`, full body pinned in API/data shapes → Migration) that maps every old `StoryProject` forward (spread `...sp` **last** so original fields always win), seeds defaults, and **never throws** (matches the existing non-object guard `:121` and the "Upgrade > crash" philosophy `:116-119`). Malformed/corrupt blobs degrade to defaults, never a white screen (D1–D6). The alias bridge keeps the 6 `storyProjects` consumers compiling. The migrate is the data-integrity gate — Test #3 enumerates the realistic v4 blob + all malformed cases.

- **Cross-platform parity (default behavior identical on macOS/Windows/Linux; platform-only features behind opt-in).** This task is **pure frontend store/UI logic in the Tauri webview** — JS/TS only, **zero platform branches, zero OS/shell/path APIs, no new Tauri permissions**. localStorage, zustand persist, React controlled inputs, and `setMode` routing behave **identically** on all three platforms. No default-feature divergence → no P0 platform risk, and nothing here is platform-only so nothing needs an opt-in gate. The two pre-existing cross-platform-identical behaviors we *inherit* (multi-window last-write-wins D5; localStorage quota D4) are the same on every OS and are not regressions. The Audiobook cover `serverPath` is a *local* backend path returned by `/audiobook/cover` and validated by `_safe_cover_path` (`audiobook.py:451`) — same code path on all platforms.

- **Local-first guarantee (no cloud, no accounts, no API keys, no third-party telemetry; app fully functional offline).** Every new field lives in **browser localStorage**; the only network contact is the **existing local backend** (`/audiobook/cover`, `/audiobook`, `/longform/render`) — **no new endpoint, no external host, no telemetry, no credential**. Nothing in this task phones home; persistence and migration work fully offline. The cover `serverPath` references the user's own local VoiceStudio backend, never a remote store.

- **CodeQL — `js/redos` / polynomial-ReDoS on user-input regex (and `py/*`).** Verified: `security.yml:94-96` runs CodeQL `security-and-quality` on **both `python` and `javascript-typescript`** (`:74`), with `*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` excluded from analysis (`:102-105`). This is a **frontend-only** task, so the relevant query is the **JS/TS ReDoS** one, not `py/*`. **This task introduces no new regex over user-pasted text** — the only new "validation" is the two-value `rec.mode === 'audiobook' ? … : …` literal-equality check (E3) and the `convertMode` membership guard (G3), and the migrate fn uses only `typeof`/`Array.isArray`/spread (no regex). Existing parsers (`parseScript.js:14-39` builds `attributionName` regexes from a `TAG_VERBS` alternation and runs them on user-pasted script via `autoCast`) are **untouched** here. ⚠️ **Hand-off flag for #24:** #24 *will* call `parseScript`/`importStory` on the `script` string to populate `tracks`. If #24 adds or modifies any regex that consumes the user `script`, it must run the ReDoS discipline from MEMORY (`codeql-redos-regex`): no overlapping `\s*`/`.+`, exclude both delimiters in `[^x]*`, atomic groups OK on py≥3.11 — and re-audit the existing `parseScript` alternations under the same lens. #31 carries the ReDoS *zero-delta*; #24 inherits the *duty*.

- **Localization (no hardcoded non-English UI text; all strings via `t()` into `i18n/locales/`; functional CJK only via the test allowlist).** Verified **21** locale files (`ls frontend/src/i18n/locales/ | wc -l = 21`: ar, de, en, es, fr, hi, id, it, ja, ko, nl, pl, pt, ru, sv, th, tr, uk, vi, zh-CN, zh-TW). 31a/31b reuse existing keys (`audiobook.*` / `stories.*` / `projects.*`); any new toast/label (`audiobook.save_project`, `audiobook.project_saved`, `audiobook.untitled`, optional cover-set label) goes through `t()` and is added to **all 21** locales **in the same PR** (a key in `en.json` but missing elsewhere is a failure, not backlog). The store's `name || 'Untitled'` fallback is an English **non-UI last-resort sentinel** (never the displayed default — each editor passes a localized `t('…untitled')`); acceptable as a code-level guard. **CJK-test note:** `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py` scans git-tracked `.jsx`/`.ts` source; the renamed `longformSlice.ts` and modified `AudiobookTab.jsx` are scanned and are **not** on `_ALLOWED_FILES` (`StoriesEditor.jsx` already is, for its existing functional CJK) — so any hardcoded CJK literal in the new/changed code fails CI. User-typed metadata in CJK (book titles, etc.) is **runtime data, exempt** (it's not a source literal; J4). Run the gate locally before push (Test #10).

- **Docs-sync (any change to README/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/SUPPORT/LICENSE/`docs/**` ships in the same PR).** Verified there is **no user-facing doc** describing Stories/Audiobook persistence in `docs/` (no `docs/features/audiobook.md` or `docs/features/stories.md`; `docs/features/` has only `diarization.md`; `docs/features.yaml` mentions neither). Internal specs exist (`docs/specs/2026-06-13-stories-audiobook-maturity.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-30-stories-editor-studio-design.md`) — update those in-PR **only if** the persistence model materially changes their description; no end-user install/feature doc requires a change. State the conclusion explicitly in the PR body ("no user-facing doc impact; updated internal spec X" or "no doc impact").

- **Versioning (continuous-to-main patch; main = latest release + 1; no RCs, no codenames, no minor/major bump, no version files touched).** This task ships **no version bump** — main already rolls at the next patch (`v0.3.6`); `tauri.conf.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml` are **untouched**. No `-rc` tag, no `v0.4` deferral: 31a/31b are absorbed into the open v0.3.x line continuous-to-main; 31c is the **#24** task (a separate open issue absorbed into the same line), not a re-versioned defer. (Note: the zustand-persist `version: 4→5` bump is the *localStorage schema* version, entirely independent of the app/release version — do not confuse the two.)

- **GSD workflow (file-changing tools only inside a GSD command).** Per CLAUDE.md, the implementing change must go through a GSD entry point — `/gsd-execute-phase` for this planned phase work — not raw `Edit`/`Write` outside a GSD workflow.

## Dependencies

- **No new npm packages.** Uses existing `zustand` + `zustand/middleware` (`persist`, `createJSONStorage`) already imported in `store/index.ts:17-18`.
- **No new Python deps** (CLAUDE.md confirms Capabilities 1/2/3/5 add none; this task touches none of them).
- **Soft dep on #24:** the `convertMode` action and mode-aware routing are *defined* here but the content-transform (`scriptToTracks`, `tracksToScript`) and the toggle button are **#24's** to fill in. The existing `utils/storyToSpans.js:21-54` is the stories→spans direction; the reverse parser would reuse `utils/parseScript.js` / `utils/importStory.js` (both already imported by `StoriesEditor.jsx:19-20`, and `parseScript` already used by `autoCast` at `:176`). #24 inherits the **ReDoS-review duty** on `parseScript`'s `TAG_VERBS` alternation regexes if it runs them on the unified `script` (Constraints → CodeQL).
- **Adjacent tasks (coordinate, don't block):** #22 (shared `<VoiceSelector>`) and #27 (unify longform parsers) touch the same two editors; land #31 store first so #22/#27 build on the unified state. (#27 — unifying the 3 longform parsers — is the natural owner of the `parseScript` ReDoS audit; #31 keeps the regex surface unchanged and hands the audit forward.)

## Risk

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Migration drops/corrupts existing saved Stories projects (the localStorage data-integrity / "no manual migration" constraint) | High | Dedicated migration unit test with a realistic v4 blob **plus** malformed-input cases (non-object, non-array `storyProjects`, null/garbage entries, missing keys, version >5, dangling `currentProjectId` — D1–D6); spread `...sp` *last* so original fields always win over defaults; `migrate` returns upgraded partial, never throws (matches the existing guard at `index.ts:121` + philosophy at `:116-119`). Full fn body pinned in API/data shapes → Migration. This `migrate` is the localStorage analog of an alembic upgrade — Test #3 is the gate. |
| Stale metadata leaks across project loads (the new working fields aren't reset) | High | The working-state reset contract: `loadProject`/`newProject` (re)set the **entire** working surface with default-fill (`SLICE_DEFAULTS`) every time (exact action bodies pinned); dedicated stale-carryover test (Test #7, edge cases A1–A4). This is the subtlest regression the task introduces. |
| Renaming `storyProjects`→`longformProjects` breaks the 6 consumers | Medium | One-PR `storyProjects` alias OR update all 6 files (`storiesSlice.ts`, `storiesSlice.test.ts`, `index.ts`, `StoriesEditor.jsx`, `Projects.jsx`, `App.jsx`) in the same PR; the test harness reads `.storyProjects` directly (`test:19,:67,:79,:103`) so either alias or port the test; grep `storyProjects` across `frontend/src` before merge. |
| Hardcoded CJK / missing-locale string sneaks into the renamed/changed source and trips CI | Medium | `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py` scans the (non-allowlisted) `longformSlice.ts` + `AudiobookTab.jsx`; route every new label through `t()`, add new keys to **all 21** locales in-PR, run the gate locally (Test #10). User-typed CJK metadata is exempt runtime data (J4). |
| Conflating client `longformProjects` with `Projects.jsx` server-side `longformJobs` | Medium | These are distinct: `longformJobs` (`Projects.jsx:102,198-211`) are completed backend render jobs; `longformProjects` are client localStorage projects flowing through the `storyProjects` prop (`:79,146-160`). Do not touch `longformJobs`. |
| Cover image can't round-trip through localStorage; stale `serverPath` | Medium | Persist only `CoverRef` (filename + `serverPath` from `audiobookUploadCover` `{path}`, `audiobook.ts:85-90`), not bytes. On reload show the filename; re-render reuses `serverPath` as `cover_path` (C2). Stale/GC'd/invalid `serverPath` (C3) surfaces a generic backend error SSE event (`audiobook.py:474`) via the existing channel, never crashes; re-picking always works. `clearCover` nulls `coverRef` (C5). Blob preview stays transient by design (matches `AudiobookTab.jsx:57-64`). serverPath is a *local* path — no cloud (Local-first). |
| `_trackId` reseed effect (`StoriesEditor.jsx:135-140`) doesn't re-run on cross-session `loadProject` → new-line id collision | Medium | Latent today (dep array `[]`, single-mount), made reachable by Projects-list load. Change dep array to `[currentProjectId]` or reseed in the add path; called out in Integration. |
| #24 imports the existing `parseScript` regexes onto the unified `script` without a ReDoS pass | Medium | #31 carries **zero** new user-input regex (Constraints → CodeQL). Explicitly hand the ReDoS-review duty to #24/#27 in Dependencies + a code comment on the `convertMode` seam so a future PR doesn't wire `parseScript` over user `script` blind to the `js/redos` gate. |
| In-flight render abandoned on tab switch / reload (no resume) | Low | Explicitly NOT resumed in v1 (F1–F3); inputs survive via store, transient render flags (component `useState`, never in `partialize`) never persist, so no ghost spinner. Backend-job resume is `longformJobs` territory, out of scope. |
| Persisting loose working metadata bloats localStorage | Low | Same pattern already used for `storyTracks` (`index.ts:109-110`). Strings + small dicts; a single big book is well under quota. No eviction policy in v1 (Stories already unbounded); D4 flags dozens-of-big-projects for v0.4 if reported. |
| Controlled-input `undefined → string` warning on v4-migrated projects | Low | Every metadata `<input value>` binds to a guaranteed default (A4) — read `meta.title ?? ''`, never bare; slice init + load-time default-fill ensure `meta.*` are always strings, `lexicon`/`coverRef` always object/null. |
| Scope creep into #24 | Medium | Hard line: 31c (mode toggle/convert UI + content transforms `scriptToTracks`/`tracksToScript`) is explicitly out; ship 31a/31b only. The "defer until #24" caveat is honored by shipping just the store + Audiobook binding whose shape is already determined by the two existing editors. |
| Two content models (`tracks` vs `script`) drift in a single project | Low (v1) | v1 keeps one authoritative per `mode`; only the matching editor binds working state. Cross-editing is #24's concern with explicit convert. `convertMode` flips the flag only (G1). |

## PR slices

- **PR 31a — `longformSlice` + migration (store-only, no UI behavior change).** Rename `store/storiesSlice.ts`→`longformSlice.ts`, generalize types (`StoryProject`→`LongformProject` from `:28-34`; `StoriesSlice`→`LongformSlice` from `:36-51`), export `SLICE_DEFAULTS` + `genProjectId`, add new working fields/actions (with the pinned signatures + bodies: merge semantics I1–I3, reset contract in `loadProject`/`newProject`, `convertMode` placeholder), alias bridge, bump persist `version` 4→5 (`index.ts:115`) + `version < 5` migrate branch with malformed-data defenses (`index.ts:120-130`, D1–D6, full fn body pinned), update the 4 import/type/spread sites in `index.ts` (`:36-37,45,63`) + the partialize block (`:107-113`, pinned diff), port + extend `storiesSlice.test.ts`→`longformSlice.test.ts` (backward-compat + new-shape + migration + stale-carryover tests). Stories and Audiobook behave exactly as today (Audiobook still local-state — not yet bound). Fully green `bunx vitest run` **and** `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py` (renamed slice scanned). Lowest-risk, fully reversible. *This is the "land now" core.*
- **PR 31b — Bind Audiobook to the store + Stories export metadata payoff.** Replace `AudiobookTab.jsx` local `useState` (`:21,22,34,35,36-38` → `text/defaultVoice/format/loudness/meta`) with store bindings (pinned selectors); keep lexicon **editable rows** local, hydrate dict→rows on mount + flush rows→`setLexicon` on change (B3); wire `clearCover`→`setCoverRef(null)` (C5) and `onCreate` cover-path resolution to reuse `coverRef.serverPath` (C2, pinned expression); Audiobook projects now save/load in the shared Projects list; make `App.jsx` `onOpenStory` (`:1054`) mode-aware + load-result-aware (E1–E5, pinned body) via `setMode` (`:110`); fix the `_trackId` reseed effect dep array (`StoriesEditor.jsx:135-140`); wire `StoriesEditor.generateAll` (`:360-402`, currently `:368-371`) to pass `metadata/loudness/cover_path` to `longformRender` with the empty-filter (J3, pinned body); branch Projects.jsx story-card icon/subtitle on `sp.mode` (`:146-160`). Adds an Audiobook "Save project" affordance reusing the Stories projects-panel pattern. i18n (save-project / project-saved / untitled / cover-set keys × **21** locales, in-PR) + docs-sync verdict in PR body. CJK gate green (AudiobookTab scanned). *Ships the user-visible win (Audiobook persistence).*
- **PR 31c — (#24 hand-off, NOT in this task) mode toggle + convert.** Implement `convertMode` content transforms (`scriptToTracks`/`tracksToScript`, reusing `parseScript`/`importStory`/`storyToSpans`), the in-editor "Open in the other editor / Convert" button, and the cross-mode open behavior. **Carries the ReDoS-review duty** on any regex run over the user `script` (Constraints → CodeQL). Tracked under #24.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `bunx vitest run` is green, including the ported backward-compat suite (`storiesSlice.test.ts:16-114`), the new migration/shape tests, the malformed-migration cases (D1–D6), and the stale-carryover test (A1–A4); and `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py` stays green with the renamed/modified source scanned (Test #10).
2. A user with existing saved Stories projects (localStorage at persist `version: 4`) reloads the app and sees the **same projects, same names, same cast/tracks**, openable in Stories with zero prompts (manual + automated migration test). A user with a *corrupted* persisted blob still boots to defaults (no white-screen crash).
3. In Audiobook, entering title/author/narrator/genre, a lexicon row, format, and loudness, then switching tabs and back (or reloading), **preserves all of it**. (Today: lost — all live in `AudiobookTab.jsx:21-48` `useState`.) Half-typed lexicon rows are not persisted as junk (B3). A CJK book title round-trips byte-for-byte (J4).
4. An Audiobook project can be **saved by name** and reappears in the shared Projects list (`Projects.jsx:146-160`) with an audiobook-appropriate card; reopening it routes to the Audiobook tab (`App.jsx:1077-1082`) with fields restored. Opening a `stories`-mode project still routes to Stories. Opening an id that no longer resolves does not route to a blank editor (E5).
5. A Stories full export (`StoriesEditor.generateAll`, `:360-402`) now sends book `metadata`/`loudness`/`cover_path` to `/longform/render` (matching the pinned `LongformRenderBody`) when the project has them (verified by the export test + a manual render whose output m4b carries the title tag); a metadata-less Stories project sends `metadata: null` with no wire regression (J3).
6. Loading project B after editing project A leaves **no field of A's metadata** in B's working state; starting a `newProject()` after an edited session yields all-default working state (A1, A2). v4-migrated projects bind controlled inputs to defined defaults (no React controlled/uncontrolled warning) (A4).
7. Cover round-trips as a reference: filename/serverPath survive reload, the persisted path is reused on re-render (C2), removing the cover nulls the reference (C5), and a stale/invalid server path degrades to a surfaced error, never a crash (C3).
8. The store exposes a `convertMode` action (idempotent, content-preserving) and `mode`-aware `loadProject`/`newProject`, with `StoryProject`/`StoriesSlice`/`createStoriesSlice` aliases still resolving (no broken imports across the 6 `storyProjects` consumers) — the documented seam #24 will consume.
9. An interrupted render (tab switch / reload mid-generate) abandons the stream without a persisted ghost spinner; inputs survive, the render does not (F1–F3).
10. **Constraints satisfied:** no new platform branches (cross-platform parity — identical on macOS/Windows/Linux); no cloud/account/telemetry/credential and only the existing local backend is contacted (local-first); zero new user-input regex (no `js/redos` delta; #24 inherits the parser ReDoS duty); all new UI strings via `t()` into all 21 locales and the CJK source gate green (localization); doc-impact verdict stated in the PR body (docs-sync); no app version-file change (versioning — the persist `version: 4→5` bump is the localStorage schema version, not the release version); change lands via a GSD command (GSD workflow).
