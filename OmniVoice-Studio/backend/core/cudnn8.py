"""cuDNN 8 side-load, and — the point of this module — a *probe* for it.

CTranslate2 (pinned at 4.4.0; the engine under WhisperX and faster-whisper)
links against **cuDNN 8**, while PyTorch 2.8+ ships cuDNN 9. The two coexist:
the Rust bootstrap side-loads ``nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.7.29`` into a
``cudnn8_compat/`` directory beside the venv's real site-packages (#827/#869),
and we ``ctypes``-preload those libraries at startup so CTranslate2's own
``LoadLibrary``/``dlopen`` finds them already resident in the process.

When that side-load is missing, CTranslate2 does not raise. It prints

    Could not locate cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll. Please make sure it is in your
    library path!

and calls ``__fastfail`` — killing the **whole backend process** with
``0xC0000409`` (STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN, surfaced as exit code
``-1073740791``). Python never gets a frame, so there is no traceback, no
fallback, and nothing for the crash notice to classify. The desktop shell
restarts the backend, the user retries, and it dies again — #1371.

The bug was never that the preload could fail. It is that we **computed the
answer and threw it away**: the old inline preload in ``main.py`` silently
``pass``-ed on a missing directory and on every ``OSError``, then handed
control to a native library that treats the same condition as fatal. So this
module keeps the outcome and exposes :func:`ctranslate2_cudnn_status`, letting
``asr_backend`` route around a doomed engine *before* calling into it —
exactly how the CTranslate2 exec-stack failure (#692) is already handled.

Deliberately stdlib-only: ``engines/_asr_sidecar/main.py`` runs in a child
process with a clean import path and must not drag in the heavy ``services``
package to get this.
