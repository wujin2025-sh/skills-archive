"""RFC 6266 ``Content-Disposition`` construction.

#1262: exporting a voice profile whose name isn't spelled in Latin letters
returned a 500:

    'latin-1' codec can't encode characters in position 22-25:
    ordinal not in range(256)

``attachment; filename="`` is exactly 22 characters, so positions 22-25 were
the first four characters of the user's own profile name. HTTP header values
are latin-1 by definition, and every download endpoint built the header by
f-string interpolation, so any name outside latin-1 — Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, emoji — crashed the request.

The sanitisers in front of those f-strings did not catch it because they all
filtered with ``str.isalnum()``, which is **True for every alphabetic script**,
not just ASCII. ``"我的声音".isalnum()`` is ``True``. They were removing
punctuation and passing the exact characters that break the header.

`content_disposition` is the one construction site: an ASCII-safe
``filename=`` that any client can read, plus the RFC 5987 ``filename*=`` that
gives modern browsers the user's real name back, correctly encoded.
