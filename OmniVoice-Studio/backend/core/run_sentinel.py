"""Deployment-agnostic backend crash forensics (#1164).

The desktop shell already makes backend process deaths self-documenting: its
death watchers write a crash marker (``src-tauri/src/crash.rs``) that the UI
surfaces as an honest "the backend crashed (exit code X)" notice. But that
forensics lives in the SHELL — a ``bun run dev`` browser session, a Docker
deployment, or a LAN-share client has no shell, so when the backend process
dies there (OOM kill, shutdown race, native abort) the only user-visible
signal is "Can't reach the local VoiceStudio backend" with ZERO diagnostics —
exactly the shape of issue #1164.

This module is the backend-side equivalent, watcher-free by design (a dead
process can't report its own death):

  - ``write_sentinel()`` drops ``run_sentinel.json`` in DATA_DIR at startup:
    {pid, started_at, version, last_activity}. ``touch_activity()`` keeps
    ``last_activity`` fresh (throttled, exception-safe) as work starts.
  - ``clear_sentinel()`` removes it on clean lifespan shutdown.
  - ``detect_unclean_shutdown()`` runs at the NEXT startup, before the new
    sentinel is written: a leftover sentinel whose pid is no longer alive
    means the previous run died without running shutdown — an unclean death.
    It is converted into a crash record in ``last_run_crash.json`` carrying
    the window the death happened in, the last known activity, and a scrubbed
    tail of ``omnivoice.log`` — the evidence a #1164-class report needs.

The record store mirrors the shell's marker store semantics on purpose
(``crash.rs``): newest-first, capped at :data:`MAX_RECORDS`, acknowledgment
is a timestamp watermark (never deletion — bug reports still need the
evidence after the user dismissed the notice), and reads are version-gated
so an unacknowledged crash from a build the user upgraded away from can't
resurface as if the new build had crashed. Read paths never write.

A leftover sentinel whose pid IS still alive is a concurrently-running second
instance (two ``uvicorn --reload`` workers, a second container sharing the
volume) — NOT a crash. We leave its sentinel alone and skip writing ours, so
neither instance can misreport the other's normal exit as a death.

``uvicorn --reload`` restarts run the lifespan shutdown (uvicorn shuts the
app down gracefully before the reloader re-execs the worker), so the sentinel
is cleared and a file-change restart never yields a false positive.

Everything here is best-effort and exception-safe: forensics must never
break real work.
