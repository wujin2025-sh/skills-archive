"""Runtime API-base injection for the served SPA (Docker / reverse-proxy).

`VITE_*` vars are inlined at build time, so a prebuilt image cannot take an
API-base override from `docker run -e`. When `OMNIVOICE_PUBLIC_API_BASE` is set,
the backend injects it into `index.html` as `window.__OMNIVOICE_API_BASE__`,
which the SPA's API resolver reads first. These helpers are pure so they can be
unit-tested without booting the app.
