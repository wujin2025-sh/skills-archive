"""Ring journal of recent backend errors — the "what just broke" store.

The global exception handler (main.py) records every unhandled exception
here. Unlike crash_log.txt (append-only plain text for humans), the journal
is structured and deduplicated, so the UI and the bug-report pipeline can
answer:

  - what was the most recent backend error? (auto-attach to a report)
  - is it the same error repeating? (count by fingerprint, "x14 since start")
  - what KIND of failure is it? (error_class — GPU_OOM, HF_AUTH_FAILED, …)

Everything stored is pre-scrubbed (core.scrub) because journal entries feed
the diagnostic bundle and prefilled GitHub issues. In-memory ring of
``_MAX_ENTRIES`` fingerprints, mirrored to ``DATA_DIR/error_journal.jsonl``
(rewritten on each record — entry count is small, atomicity beats append
here) so the journal survives restarts and the crash it just recorded.

``error_class`` values: the install-time classes reuse the locked taxonomy
keys from core.error_docs_map (HF_AUTH_FAILED, PYANNOTE_LICENSE_REQUIRED) so
docs deeplinks keep working; runtime classes (GPU_OOM, DISK_FULL,
NETWORK_ERROR, FFMPEG_MISSING) are journal-local and fall back to
DEFAULT_DOCS in lookup(). Don't add them to ERROR_DOCS without following
the 4-step mirror contract documented there.
