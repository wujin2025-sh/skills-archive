"""Shared pipeline-failure helper (plan-04 / #131).

Single source of truth for "what a failure looks like" so every emit site —
the TaskManager worker, the dub ingest pipeline, the dub/batch routers — produces
the same structured, **non-empty**, sanitized failure event instead of its own
ad-hoc ``str(e)`` (which is empty or cryptic for many exception types, and was
the root of the "extract: unknown error" reports in #122/#63).

Guarantees:
  - ``reason`` is ALWAYS non-empty (falls back to the exception class name).
  - ``detail`` / ``diagnostic`` are sanitized: HF tokens, ``*TOKEN*/*KEY*/*SECRET*``
    env values, and absolute home paths never leak (Constitution I).
  - the 5-class docs taxonomy is reused from ``core.error_docs_map`` (not
    duplicated) so the deeplink contract stays single-sourced.
