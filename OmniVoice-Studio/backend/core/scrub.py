"""Privacy scrubber for diagnostic text that may leave the machine.

Everything VoiceStudio renders into a bug report or diagnostic dump goes
through ``scrub_text()`` before it can reach a prefilled GitHub Issues URL
(the only outbound path — see CLAUDE.md Capability 2). The scrubber is the
backend twin of ``frontend/src/utils/bugReport.js``'s ``scrubText`` and
must stay at least as strict:

  - home directories → ``~`` (macOS ``/Users/<name>``, Linux ``/home/<name>``,
    Windows ``C:\\Users\\<name>``, plus the *actual* ``$HOME`` of this process)
  - credential-shaped substrings → ``***REDACTED***`` (HF tokens, GitHub
    PATs, OpenAI-style ``sk-`` keys)
  - values of env vars whose NAME matches ``*TOKEN*|*KEY*|*SECRET*|
    *PASSWORD*|*CREDENTIAL*`` — so a stack trace that interpolated a real
    secret still comes out clean

Unlike ``core.logging_filter`` (which rewrites log records in-flight and
must stay cheap), this module runs on report-sized strings at report time,
so it can afford the env-var sweep.
