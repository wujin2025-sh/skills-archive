"""Free-text voice-description → voice-design parameter mapper (issue #317).

Parity with the hosted omnivoice.app "Describe your voice" field, implemented
fully locally: a deterministic keyword/phrase mapper that projects a natural-
language description (e.g. ``"a warm elderly British storyteller, slightly
raspy"``) onto the **existing** voice-design parameter space — the same six
categories the Design tab's attribute picker drives (Gender / Age / Pitch /
Style / EnglishAccent / ChineseDialect).

Design notes
============
* **No model, no network.** This is an ordered synonym-table matcher, not an
  LLM call — it runs identically on macOS/Windows/Linux with zero deps beyond
  the stdlib, preserving the local-first guarantee.
* **Single source of truth.** Every canonical token this module can emit is
  validated at import time against the engine taxonomy in
  ``omnivoice/utils/voice_design.py`` (loaded via ``core.archetypes``), so the
  mapper can never produce an instruct item the engine validator would reject
  (the issue-#89 / #115 crash modes). The Chinese translations of each token
  (e.g. ``男``/``中年``) are *derived* from that taxonomy, never hardcoded.
* **Ordered rules, first match wins.** Within a category, rules are checked in
  a hand-ordered list so more specific phrases outrank generic ones
  ("young child" → child, not young adult; "very deep" → very low pitch, not
  low pitch). Within one rule, the earliest occurrence in the text is reported
  as the matched phrase. Deterministic by construction.
* **Graceful degradation.** Anything the taxonomy can't express (timbre words
  like "raspy", role words like "storyteller") is returned in ``unmatched`` so
  the UI can tell the user exactly which parts were ignored instead of failing
  silently (issue #317's validation-feedback note). A description with no
  matches at all yields all-``Auto`` attrs and an empty instruct.

Localization note (CLAUDE.md): the only hardcoded CJK here is
``DIALECT_PINYIN`` — a functional pinyin → Chinese-dialect-token mapping
(model vocabulary, like ``frontend/src/utils/constants.js``). Registered in
``tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py``'s allowlist with this justification.
