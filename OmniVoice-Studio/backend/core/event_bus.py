"""In-memory pub/sub event bus for real-time UI updates.

Any backend code that mutates sidebar-visible data (projects, profiles,
history) calls ``emit(kind, payload)`` and the WebSocket endpoint fans it
out to all connected frontends.  This replaces the 45 s polling band-aid
with instant push.

Events are fire-and-forget, no persistence needed — the frontend uses
the event as a "hey, refetch this" signal rather than carrying the full
data payload.
