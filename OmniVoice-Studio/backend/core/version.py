"""Single source of truth for the app version at runtime.

Read from the installed package metadata (driven by ``pyproject.toml``) so the
FastAPI/API version and exported-bundle metadata never drift to a stale literal
— the prior "0.4.0" / "0.2.7" bug, and the v0.3.6 desktop build that reported
"0.3.5" because the *frozen* backend couldn't read its own metadata.

Resolution order:
  1. installed package metadata — correct in any ``uv sync``'d env and, thanks
     to ``copy_metadata('omnivoice')`` in ``backend.spec``, in the frozen build;
  2. ``pyproject.toml`` walked up from this file — correct for a raw source
     checkout that was never installed;
  3. ``_FALLBACK_VERSION`` — a last resort, kept in lockstep with the four
     version files by ``tests/test_app_version.py`` so it can never silently
     drift again.
