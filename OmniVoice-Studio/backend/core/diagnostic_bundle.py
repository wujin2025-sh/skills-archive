"""Diagnostic bundle — everything a maintainer needs, in one drag-and-drop.

The prefilled GitHub Issues URL caps out around 8k characters, so logs can
never ride along with a report. This module zips the full picture instead:

    omnivoice-diagnostics-<timestamp>.zip
    ├── meta.json            app version, platform, python, generated-at
    ├── self_check.txt       human-readable diagnose report
    ├── self_check.json      same, structured
    ├── errors.json          recent error journal (deduped, classified)
    └── logs/
        ├── omnivoice.log.txt    last 500 lines, scrubbed
        └── crash_log.txt        last 200 lines, scrubbed

Settings → About → "Save diagnostic bundle" builds it and reveals the file;
the user drags it onto their GitHub issue. Every text member is passed
through core.scrub — the bundle is built TO leave the machine, so it must
be safe by construction. The zip is written to OUTPUTS_DIR (user-visible,
already revealed-in-folder elsewhere in the app).
