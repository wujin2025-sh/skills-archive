"""A dictation model that decodes nothing gets demoted, not re-selected forever.

`sherpa-parakeet-tdt-v3` is the curated default, and on Windows it installs
cleanly, loads without error, and returns an empty token list for clear speech
(both quantisations, both decoding methods, sherpa-onnx 1.13.3 and 1.13.4)
while whisper and zipformer transcribe the same bytes. The defect is inside
sherpa-onnx's NeMo-TDT decoder — unfixable from here by configuration.

Hard-coding a different default per OS would be a guess: we have evidence for
one platform only. So the app observes instead. When a session hears real
speech and the model returns nothing, that model is demoted ON THIS MACHINE and
stops being auto-selected, which self-corrects wherever the breakage actually
is and is a no-op everywhere it isn't.

These tests pin the demotion round trip and, critically, that the user can
always take back control by re-picking the model.
