"""The autouse shutdown-state reset must actually reset, and fail loudly.

``conftest._clean_model_manager_shutdown_state`` is the fix for #1269: a test
that runs the app lifespan leaves ``model_manager._shutting_down`` set and the
GPU pool torn down, and the next test then finds every ``run_in_executor``
raising "cannot schedule new futures after shutdown" — swallowed by the preload
path as a benign shutdown, so the symptom is a load that silently never starts.

A fixture with nothing asserting it is a fixture nobody notices breaking. The
two pairs below are deliberately order-dependent (pytest runs tests in
definition order within a file): the first test of each pair dirties exactly the
state the lifespan dirties, the second asserts it arrived clean. Delete the
fixture and the second test fails; that is the fail-before/pass-after this file
exists to provide.

The second pair covers the stale-alias half of the fixture. Test modules bind
``import services.model_manager as mm`` at COLLECTION time, and ``tests/backend/
**`` purges ``services.*`` from ``sys.modules`` after every test it owns — so in
a combined ``pytest tests/ backend/tests/`` run the alias and the live module
are two different objects, and a fixture that cleans only ``sys.modules`` leaves
the alias dirty. That is not hypothetical: it is how ``test_next_test_starts_
clean`` below failed in combined runs while passing alone. The pair fabricates
the duplicate module explicitly so the condition reproduces in isolation.
