"""A dictation model that decodes NOTHING must fall back, not fail silently.

Found on Windows with the curated default `sherpa-parakeet-tdt-v3`: the model
downloads, loads with zero errors, and is correctly detected as a TDT model
(`num_durations: 5`) — then returns an empty token list for clear speech.
Measured against the same 18.9s WAV, on the same machine, same sherpa-onnx:

    sherpa-whisper-tiny     -> "Alright, here we are. I hope that's all..."
    sherpa-zipformer-en-20m -> "ANTS BOTH IN WHAT DISGUISED THIS THAT..."
    parakeet-tdt-v3 (int8)  -> ''      <-- the curated default
    parakeet-tdt-v3 (fp32)  -> ''
    parakeet-tdt-v2 (int8)  -> ''

Ruled out as causes: quantisation (fp32 fails too), sherpa-onnx version
(1.13.3 and 1.13.4 both fail), decoding method (greedy and modified_beam both
fail), and `model_type` (explicit and auto-detect both fail). The failure is
inside sherpa-onnx's NeMo-TDT decoder, so the app cannot fix it by config —
but it must never present it to the user as "dictation is just broken".

`is_model_silent` is the guard: it separates "the user said nothing" (stay
quiet) from "the model produced nothing despite speech" (fall back to the
capture ASR engine for that session and tell the user which model failed).
