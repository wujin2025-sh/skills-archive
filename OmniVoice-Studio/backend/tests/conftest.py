"""Shared setup for backend/tests — import path + hermetic data dir.

Historically every module in this directory stubbed
``sys.modules["core.config"]`` with a bare 3-4 attribute ``ModuleType``
pointing at its own ``mkdtemp``. That stub leaked **process-wide at
collection time**: pytest imports test modules while collecting, so in any
mixed invocation (``pytest tests/... backend/tests/...``) every *later* lazy
import of ``core.config`` resolved the stub instead of the real module —
``tests/test_router_smoke.py``'s ``from main import app`` died with
ImportError (missing config attrs), and
``monkeypatch.setattr("core.config.X", ...)`` died with AttributeError
(``core`` never gets a ``config`` attribute when the name is satisfied
straight from ``sys.modules``). That was the root cause of the
order-pollution combos around test_longform_e2e (8 AttributeErrors) and
test_router_smoke (24 fixture ImportErrors).

The real ``core.config`` derives every path from ``OMNIVOICE_DATA_DIR`` at
import time, so pointing that env var at a throwaway dir *before* any test
module imports it gives the same hermeticity (issue #878: never touch the
developer's real app state) with zero ``sys.modules`` surgery. This mirrors
``tests/conftest.py``; in a mixed run whichever conftest loads first wins
(``setdefault`` semantics) and both point at a throwaway tmpdir.

Do NOT reintroduce module-level ``sys.modules`` stubs in this directory —
import the real module and rely on this conftest instead.

    ``model_manager._shutting_down`` is a module-global Event and the GPU pool is
    a module-global executor. Any test that runs the app lifespan flips both on
    the way out — ``begin_shutdown()`` plus ``_reset_gpu_pool()`` — and nothing
    puts them back, because in production that state is correct: the process is
    ending.

    Across a combined ``pytest tests/ backend/tests/`` session it is not
    correct, and it is not a cosmetic leak. A test that arrives with the flag set
    finds a shut-down executor, so its very first ``run_in_executor`` raises
    "cannot schedule new futures after shutdown" — which the preload path
    classifies as a benign shutdown and swallows. The symptom is a load that
    silently never starts: ``test_lifespan_shutdown_mid_load_is_clean_and_clears
    _sentinel`` failed on ``assert started.is_set()`` for exactly this reason,
    while passing alone.

    Reset before AND after: before so an inherited flag cannot decide this test,
    after so a test that legitimately shuts down does not hand the state on.

    Cleans the module in ``sys.modules`` AND any module-typed alias the test
    module holds (``import services.model_manager as mm`` at module scope) — the
    same stale-alias class ``asr_model_installed`` above handles. Test modules
    bind that alias at COLLECTION time; ``tests/backend/**`` purges
    ``services.*`` from ``sys.modules`` after every test it owns, so in a
    combined ``pytest tests/ backend/tests/`` run the alias and the live module
    are two different objects. Cleaning only one of them means a test dirties
    the alias and the next test reads it still dirty
    (``test_shutdown_state_isolation.py::test_next_test_starts_clean``).
