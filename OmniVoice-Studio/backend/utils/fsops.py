"""Cross-device-safe filesystem primitives.

``os.replace`` is atomic only within one filesystem; across devices it raises
``OSError(EXDEV)`` (surfacing to Windows users as ``[Errno 18]`` / ``[Errno 22]``
in past issue reports — the D:-drive/relocated-models class, #763/#479). Every
current call site derives its temp file from the destination directory, which
keeps same-device semantics — but nothing *enforced* that, and the next writer
that stages in ``%TEMP%`` and renames into a user-relocated data/models dir on
another drive reintroduces the whole class. This helper is the enforcement
point: replace when possible, degrade to copy+fsync+replace when the OS says
the two paths live on different devices.
