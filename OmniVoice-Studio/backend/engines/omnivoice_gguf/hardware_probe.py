"""Hardware probe for OmniVoice GGUF quant selection (GGUF-01).

Extends ``backend/services/gpu_sandbox.py``'s existing
CUDA / MPS / ROCm / CPU detection with VRAM bucketing so the
``OmniVoiceGGUFBackend`` can pick the right quant from
``quant_map.json``.

Thresholds are deliberately conservative — see
``docs/adr/SPIKE-01-gguf-research.md``
§"Hardware probe extension" (Pitfall 2). The "default Q8_0 once you have
~1 GB of free VRAM" rule means we step up to Q8_0 at the 4 GB total-VRAM
mark, not at the 1 GB free-VRAM mark — Q8_0 itself uses ~945 MB at runtime
and we want headroom for the rest of the app.

Public surface:
    ComputeClass            — Literal["cpu", "low-vram", "mid-vram", "high-vram"]
    HardwareCapabilities    — frozen dataclass with backend + vram_mb + compute_class
    detect_capabilities()   — runs the probe, returns a HardwareCapabilities

The probe MUST be cheap (no model loads, no CUDA kernel launches) so it
can run at app startup without slowing the cold-start path. Everything
in this module sticks to ``torch.cuda.mem_get_info`` (a CUDA driver
call, not a kernel), ``torch.backends.mps.is_available`` (a constant
check), and ``psutil.virtual_memory`` (a sysctl).

    Cheap and side-effect free — no model loads, no kernel launches.

    Order of probes:
        1. ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` → "cuda" with total VRAM from
           ``torch.cuda.mem_get_info()``. (ROCm presents as CUDA via
           HIP — we tag as "cuda" since the user-facing distinction is
           by VRAM, not by silicon.)
        2. ``torch.backends.mps.is_available()`` → "mps" with half of
           system RAM. MPS unified memory means we can't query a
           dedicated VRAM pool the way we can on CUDA; the half-of-RAM
           heuristic matches what Apple uses for its own MPS budget
           recommendations.
        3. Otherwise → "cpu" with vram_mb=0.
