"""IndexTTS-2 venv probe + lazy bootstrap (Phase 2 Plan 02-03).

The parent process needs to know *which Python interpreter* to spawn the
IndexTTS sidecar under. This module owns that resolution. The probe runs
in three steps, in priority order, so the experience for existing
v0.2.7 users is transparent (their existing clone + venv is reused
verbatim — no re-download of the 6 GB model, no re-install of the
indextts package).

Probe order (Open Question #1 resolution from 02-RESEARCH.md):

    1. ``${OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR}/.venv/`` (or ``Scripts\\python.exe`` on
       Windows). Highest priority — power users who already cloned
       IndexTTS and ran ``uv pip install -e .`` get zero migration cost.
    2. ``backend/engines/indextts/.venv/`` — this package's own venv,
       created by step 3 if needed. Survives across OmniVoice upgrades;
       the IndexTTS clone is referenced via ``uv pip install -e`` so
       weights and code live in the user's clone, not under OmniVoice.
    3. Bootstrap: run ``uv venv`` then ``uv pip install -e
       ${OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR}`` to populate step-2's venv. Requires
       OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR to be set (otherwise we don't know where
       the IndexTTS clone is); we raise with a clear error message that
       points at the install docs.

Caching: the resolution is memoised after the first successful call.
Tests reset the cache via :func:`invalidate`.

Threat model (Plan 02-03 frontmatter):

    T-02-08 — sidecar HF_TOKEN logging:
        Bootstrap never touches the token; the sidecar's stderr is
        drained by SubprocessBackend through the parent root logger
        where the Phase 1 ``HFTokenRedactor`` filter strips token bytes.
    T-02-09 — supply chain (uv pip install -e):
        Bootstrap installs from a user-controlled local directory
        (``OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR``). The user already trusts that
        directory's contents (it's their own clone). Accepted for now; a
        later hardening pass can hash-pin the indextts requirements.
