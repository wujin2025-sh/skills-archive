"""IndexTTS-2 sidecar package (Phase 2 Plan 02-03).

IndexTTS-2 runs in its own subprocess + dedicated venv with
``transformers<5``, isolated from the OmniVoice parent process which
pins ``transformers>=5.3``. Closes issue #42 — the canonical
``OffloadedCache`` ImportError driven by the transformers v4 ↔ v5
incompatibility — by making the two libraries live in separate OS
processes.

Three public entry points live in this package:

  * ``IndexTTS2Backend`` (this module) — the SubprocessBackend subclass
    that ``services.tts_backend._REGISTRY`` resolves lazily on first
    access. The class is defined HERE rather than inside
    ``services.tts_backend`` because importing ``SubprocessBackend`` at
    that module's top level would cycle with
    ``services.subprocess_backend``'s ``from services.tts_backend import
    TTSBackend`` line. Defining the class in this package breaks the
    cycle: ``services.tts_backend`` finishes loading before anything
    here is imported.
  * ``main.py`` — the sidecar entrypoint (runs under a different venv).
  * ``bootstrap.py`` — the venv-probe + lazy-bootstrap helper.

Do NOT import ``main.py`` from the parent process — it runs under a
different venv and may not have access to the parent's installed
packages. The parent only ever spawns it as a subprocess.

    """IndexTTS2 (Bilibili) — runs in its own subprocess + dedicated venv.

    Plan 02-03 migrated IndexTTS off the in-process import path because
    IndexTTS pins ``transformers<5`` while OmniVoice pins
    ``transformers>=5.3``. The two cannot share a Python interpreter
    without one of them blowing up at import time (issue #42 — the
    canonical ``OffloadedCache`` ImportError). Running IndexTTS in a
    subprocess with its own venv lets both libraries co-exist.

    Key differentiators preserved from the in-process incarnation:
      * **Emotion decoupling** — clone timbre from one reference, apply
        emotion from a completely separate source (audio, 8-float
        vector, or text).
      * **Duration control** — first AR model to precisely target
        output length (critical for video dubbing lip-sync).
      * **8-float emotion vector** — [happy, angry, sad, afraid,
        disgusted, melancholic, surprised, calm] — each 0.0–1.0.
      * **Text-based emotion** — natural-language emotion descriptions
        via a fine-tuned Qwen3 encoder, ``emo_alpha`` capped at 0.6.

    Installation (transparent to existing v0.2.7 users — ENGINE-07)::

        git clone https://github.com/index-tts/index-tts.git
        cd index-tts && uv pip install -e .   # NOT uv sync --all-extras
        hf download IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2 --local-dir=checkpoints

    Set ``OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR`` to the repo root. OmniVoice will
    create ``backend/engines/indextts/.venv`` lazily on first launch if
    no venv exists yet — the user's existing
    ``${OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR}/.venv`` is preferred if present, so no
    re-install is needed.
