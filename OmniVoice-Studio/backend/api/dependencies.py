Shared FastAPI dependencies.

These are intentionally tiny — one concern per dependency — so they can be
composed at the route or router level without surprises.

Currently exposed:
- `require_loopback`: 403 unless the request came from a loopback origin
  (bypassed in explicit server mode — see `_server_mode`).
- `ws_remote_authorized`: whether a WebSocket handshake from a non-loopback
  client carries the remote API key (Wave 2.3) — used by WS endpoints that
  keep their own inline loopback guards.

    so existing tests for `/system/set-env` keep passing without modification.

    In server mode (Docker, see `_server_mode`) the loopback origin is
    unenforceable, so the gate can't require true loopback. It then applies the
    admin-credential rule instead:

    - No credential configured (no API key, no PIN) → open, matching the #261
      Docker flow where the operator reaches ``/system/*`` off the bridge
      gateway with nothing set.
    - A credential IS configured → the request must present the **API key**.
      This keeps the two-tier privilege model intact under server mode:
      ``OMNIVOICE_TRUSTED_NETWORKS`` is a *consumption* exemption
      (``is_local_host``) that bypasses the PIN / API-key middleware, and it must
      NEVER by itself unlock the admin surface (``/system/set-env`` — RCE-class —
      and ``/api/settings/*``). The 6-digit share PIN is a consumption credential
      too and does not gate admin, so a PIN-only deployment keeps admin
      loopback-only; remote admin requires the (long) API key. A LAN client in a
      trusted CIDR — or one holding only the PIN — gets 403 here even though it
      sails through the consumption gates. See docs/api-auth.md (#1213).
