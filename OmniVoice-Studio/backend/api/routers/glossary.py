"""
Glossary router — Phase 1.3 (ROADMAP.md).

Project-scoped CRUD for translation terms. `project_id` here is the dub-job id
(shared ID space with `studio_projects.id` once saved), so a glossary attached
to a draft job moves with it when the user saves the project.

Endpoints:
    GET    /glossary/{project_id}                 → list terms
    POST   /glossary/{project_id}                 → add one term
    PUT    /glossary/{project_id}/{term_id}       → update
    DELETE /glossary/{project_id}/{term_id}       → remove
    POST   /glossary/{project_id}/auto-extract    → LLM proposes terms from segments

The translator service (`backend/services/translator.py`) already accepts
`glossary: [{source, target, note}]` on its request; the frontend loads the
stored list, passes it into `/dub/translate`, and that's the full loop.
