"""Longform Job Library (PR 7).

``GET /longform/jobs`` — list finished Audiobook + Story renders so the user can
re-download them from the Projects view. The render itself (the m4b/mp3) already
landed in ``OUTPUTS_DIR`` and is served at ``/audio/<output>``; here we just
recover, from each finished job's persisted SSE tail, the output filename plus
the chapter count and duration the ``done`` event carried.

Pure recovery, no synthesis. Defensive by construction: a job whose ``done``
event is missing or unparseable is skipped, never surfaced and never a 500.

The work lives in :func:`build_longform_library`, a pure function over the
job-store callables, so it's unit-testable without importing ``main`` (and the
torch graph behind it).
