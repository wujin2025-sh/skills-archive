"""
Streaming ASR via WebSocket — live partial transcription results.

Client streams audio chunks (PCM/WebM) and receives partial + final
transcription JSON messages in real-time. Used by CaptureButton for
live dictation feedback.

Protocol:
    → Client sends binary audio frames (16-bit PCM or WebM/Opus blobs)
    ← Server sends JSON messages:

    Opt-in AEC mode (``?aec=1[&sr=16000]``, parity Action 8b): for dictating
    while the app plays audio. Frames must be raw int16 mono PCM, each tagged
    with a 1-byte prefix — 0x00 = microphone, 0x01 = playback reference. The
    server runs an NLMS echo canceller, cleaning the mic against the reference
    before transcription. Without the param the protocol is unchanged.
        {"type": "partial", "text": "Hello wor..."}      — interim result
        {"type": "final",   "text": "Hello world.",       — committed result
         "segments": [...], "language": "en",
         "duration_s": 4.2, "transcription_time_s": 0.8,
         "engine": "mlx-whisper"}
        {"type": "status",  "stage": "downloading"|"loading"|"ready"}
                                                          — model cold-start
        {"type": "error",   "message": "...", "kind": "...",
         "detail": "..."}                                  — error ("detail"
                                                          kept for legacy)

    Every ``final`` text is normalised by services.text_polish (leading
    capital for Latin scripts, terminal punctuation, single-spaced) so the
    pasted result reads like typed text. Partials are raw.
