"""Voice-design "describe your voice" API (issue #317).

Maps a free-text voice description onto the existing design parameter space
via the deterministic keyword mapper in ``core.describe_voice``. Pure CPU +
stdlib — no model, no network — so it imports and responds instantly in any
environment, including test/CI without model weights.
