"""Phase 1: settings table for encrypted HF token persistence

Revision ID: 0001_phase1_settings
Revises:
Create Date: 2026-05-20 00:00:00.000000

This is the first hand-written alembic migration in VoiceStudio. Before
v0.3.0 the schema lived entirely in `backend/core/db.py::_BASE_SCHEMA`
with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. We keep that pattern for fresh
installs (both paths converge on the same schema) and use this migration
for explicit v0.2.7 → v0.3.0 upgrades that can be inspected, downgraded,
and tested in CI.

Behavior:
  - upgrade(): adds `settings(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at REAL NOT NULL)`. Uses checkfirst=True so re-running on a
    DB that already has the table (because _BASE_SCHEMA created it on a
    previous boot) is a no-op rather than an error — this is the
    backward-compat contract for v0.2.7 users (per CLAUDE.md
    "Backward-compatible project data" constraint).
  - downgrade(): drops the settings table cleanly. Used by tests; not
    expected to run in production.
