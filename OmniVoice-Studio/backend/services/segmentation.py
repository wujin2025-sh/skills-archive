Rules (in priority order):
  1. Never split mid-word. Whitespace or nothing.

  3. Reject any candidate split that leaves either side below the minimum floor.

    * ``num_speakers=1`` → every segment gets ``"Speaker 1"``.
    * ``num_speakers>=2`` → labels round-robin across N speakers at each
      gap boundary, so the user's requested count is represented instead of

    > SPEAKER_GAP pause still collapse into one label, and N is an upper
    bound — audio with fewer gap boundaries than N yields fewer labels.
    Real per-speaker attribution needs pyannote (or an inline-diarizing ASR
