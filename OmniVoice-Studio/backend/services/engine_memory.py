"""Single-active-TTS-engine memory discipline.

Only one TTS engine's model stays resident at a time. When the generate path
resolves an engine, every *other* resident engine is unloaded first — so the
previous engine's model is handed back instead of stacking in memory until GC.

Why this matters (measured on a 16 GB M2): a generate on ``omnivoice`` leaves
its ~2.8 GB core model resident; a subsequent generate on ``mlx-audio`` loaded
that engine's model **on top** (footprint 3.9 GB → 4.3 GB, both resident),
because the two live in different caches with no coordination — the core in
``model_manager.model``, the rest in ``engines._ENGINE_INSTANCES`` (which was
never unloaded). That accumulation is the baseline that pushes a 16 GB machine
into the memory pressure behind the "Can't reach the local backend" OOM deaths.

Default on. Opt out with ``OMNIVOICE_SINGLE_ENGINE_RESIDENT=0`` on machines with
RAM to spare (keeping several engines warm avoids the reload latency on an A/B
switch — ~8 s for the VoiceStudio core, ~1–2 s for the lighter engines).
