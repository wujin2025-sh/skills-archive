Incremental re-dub — Phase 4.1 (ROADMAP.md), the other defensible bet.

Given the current dub state + a prior state, compute the minimum set of
segments whose audio needs regenerating. A segment needs re-gen when any of
its *generation inputs* changed:

    text · target_lang · profile_id · instruct · speed · direction

Deterministic content hash per segment is the key. We store the hash on the
segment after every successful generation; when re-dubbing, we hash again and
only queue segments whose hash differs from the stored one.

This isn't full crossfade-at-the-edges yet — that comes with Phase 4.5. For
now the caller re-runs `/dub/generate` with a filtered segments list.

    Any change to `_GEN_INPUT_FIELDS` flips the hash and the segment becomes
    a re-gen candidate. Changes to position / selection state / lip-sync
    badge don't trigger regen, which is what we want.

    Currently includes: text, target_lang, profile_id, instruct, speed,
    direction, effect_preset. Values are canonicalised (see `_canon_value`)
    so a fingerprint computed from the generate request (server defaults
    filled in) matches one recomputed later from the client's raw segment
    state — the root cause of #281's "1 edit re-dubs all N lines".

    ``track_lang`` (P1.3) is the TRACK's language code (`req.language_code`,
    e.g. "es"). It is part of the fingerprint because the same segment text
    renders different audio per language — without it, a bn hash could
    vouch for an es WAV on a multi-track job. It is only mixed in when
    provided, so hashes computed by legacy callers (and hashes stored by
    previous builds, which never carried a language) keep their old values;
    a legacy hash therefore never matches a lang-scoped fingerprint and the
    segment reads as stale — the safe direction (one clean regen, never a
    wrong-language splice).

    ``voice_match`` is the job-level voice-identity mode (DubRequest.voice_match).
    "consistent" resolves `auto:`/default `auto-seg:` bindings to a different
    reference than "per_line" does, so audio rendered under one mode must not
    vouch for the other — flipping the toggle has to mark segments stale, or
    "Regen changed" would splice mixed-identity voices (#281 class). Same
    back-compat trick as ``track_lang``: only mixed in when NON-DEFAULT, so
    every hash stored by previous builds (and by per_line runs) keeps its
    value and per_line stays byte-identical to the pre-toggle behaviour.
