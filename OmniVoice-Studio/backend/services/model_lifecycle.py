"""Single lifecycle surface for loaded models (MM2-04).

Before this, ``GET /model/loaded`` and ``POST /model/unload`` each hand-rolled
enumeration/dispatch across three worlds — the in-process TTS+ASR model
(``model_manager``), the diarization pipeline, and subprocess sidecars
(``subprocess_backend``). This module owns that logic so the routers are thin
delegations and there's one place to reason about model lifecycle.

Response shapes are preserved exactly — the frontend (hooks.ts model status +
the flush dropdown) depends on ``{models, count}`` and
``{unloaded, success, ...}``.
