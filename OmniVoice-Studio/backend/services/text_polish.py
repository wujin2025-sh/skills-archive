"""
Deterministic polish for dictation finals (dictation v2).

Every ``final`` that leaves ``/ws/transcribe`` passes through
:func:`polish_text` so pasted dictation reads like typed text:

  * leading capital -- Latin scripts only (CJK/Cyrillic/etc. untouched),
  * terminal punctuation -- a period is appended unless the text already
    ends with sentence-terminal punctuation (incl. the CJK fullwidth forms),
  * doubled spaces collapsed, leading/trailing whitespace stripped.

Purely rule-based -- no model, no locale detection, no network -- so it is
byte-for-byte reproducible and idempotent (``polish(polish(x)) == polish(x)``).

CJK codepoints below are ``\\u``-escaped on purpose: this is functional
punctuation handling (allowed), and the escapes keep this file outside the
literal-CJK scan in ``tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py`` without growing its
allowlist.
