"""SRT (SubRip subtitle) parser.

Lenient by design — many "SRT" files in the wild are slightly off-spec
(missing index numbers, blank-line variants, BOM, `.` instead of `,` in
the milliseconds separator). We accept what we can, drop what we can't,
and report counts so the caller can warn the user.

Returns a list of segments compatible with the dub-pipeline shape used
elsewhere in the backend:

    {
        "id": int,
        "start": float,             # seconds
        "end": float,               # seconds
        "text": str,
        "text_original": str,       # same as `text` on import; mutable later
        "speaker_id": "Speaker 1",  # filler — no diarization on raw .srt
    }
