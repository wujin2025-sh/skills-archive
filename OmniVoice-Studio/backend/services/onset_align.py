Speech-onset alignment for transcript segments (issue #280, item 1).

Whisper-family ASR models are prone to stretching a segment's *start* back
over leading non-speech (intro music, room tone, silence). The classic
symptom from the issue report: the speaker starts talking at 0:02–0:03,
but the first transcript segment says ``start=0.0`` — so the dubbed line
plays the moment the video begins and everything feels desynchronised.

``snap_segment_starts`` post-processes segments against the actual audio
(ideally the Demucs-isolated vocals track, which the dub pipeline already
produces): for each segment it scans the waveform inside ``[start, end]``
for the first *sustained* rise of frame RMS above an adaptive threshold
and moves ``start`` forward to just before that onset.

Design constraints:

* **Forward-only.** A segment start is never moved earlier — that could
  collide with the previous speaker. We only trim leading non-speech.
* **Conservative.** Shifts below ``min_shift_s`` are ignored (word-level
  timestamps are usually within ~100 ms already); a minimum segment
  duration is always preserved; segments whose window looks silent
  (no frame above the absolute floor) are left untouched.
* **Pure NumPy.** No model, no platform-specific code — identical
  behaviour on macOS / Windows / Linux, trivially unit-testable.

Robustness against non-speech onsets (#963): a field report showed dubbed
lines starting seconds off because "when a noise is heard (a sigh or
footsteps), it's interpreted as the start of the conversation". Three
guards address that class of failure:

* **Sustained energy.** A frame only counts as an onset when the energy
  stays up for a speech-like duration (``SUSTAIN_MIN_S`` within the
  following ``SUSTAIN_WINDOW_S``). Footsteps/door thuds/clicks light up
  one or two 20 ms frames and die; syllables keep the energy up.
* **Bounded snap distance.** Shifts beyond ``MAX_SNAP_S`` are only
  trusted when everything being skipped is (near-)silence — the genuine
  #280 whisper start-stretch, where Demucs removed the leading music and
  left real silence on the vocals track. Jumping far over *audible*
  content (e.g. quiet speech sitting under the relative threshold) would
  play the dub seconds late, so it is refused.
* **Source-aware.** Snapping only runs on a separated vocals track
  (``separated_vocals=True``). On mixed/original audio — Demucs skipped
  or failed — music, ambience and room tone are all legitimate sustained
  energy, so any detected "onset" is as likely the score as the speaker;
  whisper's own timestamps beat a confidently wrong snap.
