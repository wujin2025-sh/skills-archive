"""
Dub-pipeline service — Phase 2.4 (ROADMAP.md).

Extracts the non-HTTP business logic out of the 889-line `dub_core.py` router
so the router can stay thin (HTTP concerns only) and this module can be
imported cleanly by other routers (dub_generate, dub_translate, dub_export)
and future callers (the Tools page, the headless CLI, tests).

What's here
-----------
* **Job state** — `_dub_jobs` in-memory dict + `get_job` / `save_job` that
  hydrate from `dub_history.job_data` on cache miss.
* **Content-hash cache lookup** — `compute_file_hash`, `find_cached_job`.
* **Safe path resolution** — `safe_job_dir`.
* **Process lifecycle** — ffmpeg/demucs subprocess tracking + `kill_job_procs`
  so `POST /dub/abort/{id}` can tear down in-flight work (implemented in
  `services.proc_registry`, re-exported here for compatibility).
* **SSE helpers** — `sse_event`, `prep_event`.

What stays in the router
------------------------
The route decorators + request-body validation + response shaping. The big
ingest/transcribe generators still live there for now — they're tightly
coupled to FastAPI's `StreamingResponse`/async-generator contract, and
moving them is a follow-up.

#: "not written yet" for a new job and "deleted" for an established one — two
#: opposite instructions from one signal.
#:
#: Scoped to DELETED, not to in-flight ingests. Scoping it to ingests looked
#: right and closed nothing that mattered: a dub is imported once and rendered
#: many times, so the realistic delete lands during a RENDER, long after its
#: ingest ended — and a render's save would then write the row straight back.
#:
#: Retained rather than cleared on completion, because there is no moment at
#: which a delete stops mattering: any operation still holding that job can
#: persist it. ``begin_ingest`` drops an id explicitly, since re-importing is a
#: deliberate revival.
#:
#: Expired by AGE, not by count. A count-bounded LRU is evictable by ordinary
#: use: ``DELETE /dub/history`` purges every row with no limit, so a user
#: clearing a large history mid-render would push the rendering job's own
#: marker out and the render would then write it back (#1252 review). Age
#: cannot be gamed that way — what matters is how long ago the delete happened,
#: not how many others followed it.
