"""Self-heal for HF cache snapshots whose entries no longer resolve.

The Hugging Face hub cache stores each file's bytes once under
``models--<org>--<name>/blobs/<hash>`` and exposes every revision as
``snapshots/<rev>/<filename>`` entries that link into ``blobs/``. Several
real-world events leave a snapshot entry *broken* — a dangling symlink (its
blob target doesn't exist) or a zero-byte stand-in file — while the actual
bytes are safely on disk under ``blobs/``: a blob-naming mismatch between
download modes, an interrupted rename mid-download, antivirus interference.

``os.path.isfile()`` on a dangling symlink is False, so transformers concludes
the weights are missing ("… does not appear to have a file named
pytorch_model.bin or model.safetensors") even though the multi-GB download
completed. A plain ``snapshot_download`` doesn't reliably fix this — depending
on hub version and platform symlink support, the existing-but-broken entry can
short-circuit the restore. Deleting exactly the broken entries first makes
``snapshot_download`` deterministically restore them (reusing completed blobs
where the naming matches, re-downloading only where it doesn't).

Conservative by design, repairing STATE rather than chasing one cause:
  * never touches ``blobs/`` (the downloaded bytes),
  * never touches snapshot entries that resolve,
  * never force-redownloads healthy files,
  * never raises — any internal failure logs and returns a summary,
  * a healthy cache is a cheap lstat/stat walk of ``snapshots/`` (no hashing,
    no network) on every platform; the heal is generic, not Windows-gated.
