"""Single audited audio-write path for VoiceStudio — closes BUG-01 / issue #48.

All in-tree audio-write call sites in ``backend/api/routers/`` converge on
the helpers in this module:

* ``_safe_torchaudio_save`` — wraps ``torchaudio.save``. Defends against the
  four documented failure modes that produce silently-corrupt WAVs:

      1. CUDA / MPS tensor handed to a backend that can only serialize CPU
         tensors → header looks valid, data chunk is empty.
      2. Non-contiguous tensor (after ``torch.cat`` of sliced segments) →
         the soundfile backend reads bytes in stride order, the file ends
         up containing interleaved garbage that decodes as noise.
      3. Out-of-range float values (``apply_mastering`` produces transient
         peaks > 1.0 on dynamic input) → TorchCodec 2.9+ clamps to int16
         silently, low-volume tracks become silence after clipping.
      4. Non-float32 dtype (float64 from numpy round-trips, int16 from a
         previous decode) → TorchCodec 2.9+ requires float32-in-[-1, 1]
         and the soundfile backend's dtype handling differs from sox's,
         producing inaudible output on some platforms.

  We also pass ``encoding`` and ``bits_per_sample`` *explicitly* so that
  torchaudio's backend auto-selection (sox → soundfile → TorchCodec in
  2.9+) cannot silently change the on-disk format between versions.

* ``_safe_soundfile_write`` — sibling helper for the one in-tree
  ``sf.write`` site (``dub_core.py``). soundfile's API surface differs
  from torchaudio's (numpy array, ``subtype`` instead of ``encoding`` +
  ``bits_per_sample``) so it gets its own entry point with the same
  sanity checks (dtype / contiguity / shape / range).

* ``atomic_save_wav`` — pre-existing P0 helper (commit fb52140). Writes
  to a sibling temp file in the same directory and ``os.replace()`` into
  place so the target either holds a complete WAV or its previous
  contents — never a truncated one. ``atomic_save_wav`` now delegates
  the actual encode to ``_safe_torchaudio_save`` so the atomicity and
  correctness guarantees compose: every byte that ever lands at the
  target path was produced by the audited helper.

A regression-grep gate in ``tests/backend/test_dub_pipeline_wav.py``
asserts that ``backend/api/routers/`` contains zero direct
``torchaudio.save`` / ``soundfile.write`` / ``sf.write`` calls. Future
code that adds an audio write must go through one of the helpers in
this module.

Closes #48 / BUG-01.

    The caller hands us a tensor that may have come from a GPU model, may
    have been concatenated from non-contiguous slices, may carry transient
    peaks above 1.0 from upstream mastering, and may not even be float32.
    We normalize all of those before delegating to ``torchaudio.save`` so
    the on-disk WAV always has a valid header and audible samples.

            ``(channels, samples)`` (2D). Any device, any dtype.
        sample_rate: WAV sample rate in Hz.
        format: Container format. ``"wav"`` (default), ``"flac"``,
            ``"mp3"``, or ``"ogg"`` (passed through to torchaudio).
        bits_per_sample: 16 (default, ``PCM_S``) or 32 (``PCM_F``).
            Ignored for non-WAV formats where the codec controls the
            sample width.

            zero-length WAV would decode silently as "no error, no
            audio" — exactly the failure mode #48 was about, so we
