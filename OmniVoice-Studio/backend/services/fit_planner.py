"""Smart Fit planner — dub-length fitting v2, Phase A.

Pure planning functions for the ``smart_fit`` timing strategy: given the
original segment timeline and the *natural-rate* duration of each dubbed
segment's TTS audio, decide per segment how to reconcile the two by
splitting the burden between a mild pitch-preserving audio speed-up and a
mild per-segment video slow-down.

Clean-room note: this is a reimplementation from a *published description*
of the audio-speedup + video-slowdown fitting approach (see
docs/competitive-analysis.md, "Dub-length fitting"). No GPL source was
consulted.

Algorithm per segment (defaults in :class:`FitParams`):

1. **Slack absorption** — the usable slot extends past the segment's
   original end into the silent gap before the next segment, keeping a
   small ``gap_guard_s`` clear of the next onset (the last segment may run
   to the end of the video). ``need = natural_dur / slot``.
2. ``need <= 1.0`` — fits as-is; nothing to do.
3. ``1.0 < need <= max_audio_only_rate`` — audio-only speed-up at exactly
   ``need`` (imperceptible up to ~1.2×).
4. ``need > max_audio_only_rate`` — geometric 50/50 split:
   ``audio_rate = min(sqrt(need), audio_rate_cap)`` and
   ``video_ratio = min(need / audio_rate, video_slow_cap)``. Whatever the
   caps can't absorb becomes ``overflow_s`` (trimmed at mix time).
5. ``allow_video_retime=False`` — audio-only mode: rate capped at the
   legacy ``MAX_AUDIO_RATE_HARD`` (1.8, matching dub_generate's
   MAX_STRETCH_RATIO guard rail), residual overflows.
6. **Timeline cursor** — mirrors the existing ``stretch_video`` layout
   loop: pre-roll and inter-segment gaps pass through at 1.0×; each
   segment's video chunk ``[start, effective_end]`` occupies
   ``slot * video_ratio`` on the new timeline.

This module is deliberately I/O-free and torch-free so it can be unit- and
golden-tested without a model, ffmpeg, or an event loop.
