      — the job is cancelled out of the queue before it ever runs, so no

    Previously both were one clock started at submit: ``run_in_executor``
    returns immediately, so a job queued behind a busy 1-worker pool burned its
    entire budget waiting and then reported "too heavy for the available
    compute" without having executed one instruction.

    ``fn`` must be a zero-arg callable — wrap args with ``functools.partial``.
    Executors without ``reset`` (a plain ThreadPoolExecutor in tests) still get
    both bounds; only the reset step is skipped.

    ``min_vram_gb`` is the declared VRAM floor of the engine this job belongs
