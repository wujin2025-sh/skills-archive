"""
Speech-rate engineering — Phase 4.4 (ROADMAP.md).

Before TTS generation, predict how long the target-language text will take
to read at a natural pace. If it overshoots the source slot (= lip-sync
will drift), ask the LLM to trim filler or slightly reflow. If it undershoots,
expand. Loop until fit or max retries.

Runs as a post-process on Cinematic translator output or manually via
`adjust_for_slot(...)`. Fast mode skips this — the whole point is the
LLM-aware trimming, and Fast-mode users opted out of LLM calls.

Returns the fit text + a `rate_ratio` (text chars / slot-aligned chars).

    bound is 1.0 instead of ``TOL_HIGH`` — the line must fit *within* the
    slot, never overrun it — so the target-language reading time can't exceed
    the segment and push the video timing out. Lines under ``TOL_LOW`` still
    go through the LLM expand pass in strict mode too (same as loose mode);
    padding is bounded by the divergence guard below, and a line under
    ``_MIN_EXPANDABLE_RATIO`` is never expanded at all — it could only "fill"
    the slot with fabricated dialogue, so it stays short. Best-effort: after
    ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` it returns the closest candidate seen, so a stubborn line
    degrades gracefully.

    Every LLM reply is validated with ``translator.refine_output_ok`` against
    the ORIGINAL input ``text`` (not the previous candidate — divergence
    compounds across attempts otherwise). A reply that fails the guard is
    discarded: the attempt is burned, ``current``/``best`` stay put, and if
    nothing valid ever came back the input text is returned with
