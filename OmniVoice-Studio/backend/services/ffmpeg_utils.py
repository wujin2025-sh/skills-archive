# ── Background-bed mixing (dub voice over the separated no_vocals stem) ──────
#
# Every dub export mixes the synthesized voice track over the original video's
# separated background (music/ambience). Two fidelity bugs lived in the old
# per-site `amix` strings, and they are exactly what "the background music
# doesn't sound like the original" reports describe:
#
#   1. LEVEL — `amix` NORMALIZES: each input is scaled by weight/sum(weights).
#      The old `weights=0.8 1.2` therefore played the music bed at 40% of its
#      original level (−8 dB) and the voice at 60%. (batch.py was worse still:
#      an explicit volume=0.15 plus amix's ÷2 left the bed at 7.5%.) We keep
#      amix for its duration/dropout semantics but multiply the mix by
#      sum(weights) afterwards, which cancels the normalization exactly — the
#      weights below ARE the absolute gains.
#   2. BANDWIDTH — the voice track is synthesized at 24 kHz and amix
#      negotiates one common rate, so the 44.1/48 kHz bed was silently
#      downsampled to 24 kHz: everything above 12 kHz (cymbals, air,
#      brightness) vanished from the music. Both inputs are now explicitly
#      resampled to 48 kHz before the mix, so the bed keeps its top end.
#
# Bed at −0.9 dB (0.9×) keeps the music essentially at the original level
# while letting dialogue sit just above it; the limiter transparently catches
# the rare summed peak that now can exceed full scale (the old normalization
# made clipping impossible by making everything quiet).

    both streams are active — after the (usually marginally shorter) voice
    stream ends, the bed's internal scale jumps from w/sum to 1.0 and a fixed
    multiply would BOOST the tail music into the limiter. ``normalize=0``
    turns amix into a plain sum, immune to stream-end rescaling. Old system
    ffmpegs (<5) lack the option and would reject the whole graph, so probe

    Async so it never blocks the event loop: it's awaited from the dub
    generate `_stream` generator, and each ffmpeg call is ~50-100 ms — a
    synchronous ``subprocess.run`` here froze health-checks / SSE / every
    concurrent request for the whole multi-segment job.

    Returns a (1, target_samples) tensor on the same device as input.
    Raises RuntimeError when ffmpeg fails — callers should fall back to
    naive linear interpolation, accepting the pitch shift, to ensure the
    output isn't silent.
