"""Map subtitle cues onto the Smart-Fit timeline (Wave 3.1 / Spec 1).

When a dub uses ``stretch_video`` mode, the video is re-timed per segment so
the dubbed audio fits (see fit_planner + the export stretch filter). The
dubbed audio therefore plays at *fitted* positions, not the original
timestamps. A subtitle file exported with the original times would drift
against the dubbed video — so we regenerate the cue timeline from the same
plan the video stretch uses ("subtitles track actual dub placement", the
last piece of Spec 1).

Pure functions — no I/O — so the remapping is unit-testable. The plan is the
persisted ``video_stretch_plan`` list of
``{orig_start, orig_end, new_start, new_end, stretch_ratio}`` chunks.
