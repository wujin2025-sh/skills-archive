"""Local-only usage insights — the privacy-preserving answer to "how am I using this?".

The alternative to cloud analytics (PostHog was proposed and rejected, PR #1110):
this collects **nothing new** and transmits **nothing anywhere**. It simply
aggregates the rows the app has *already* written to the user's own SQLite
database in the course of doing its job — generation history, voice profiles,
dubs, exports — and hands back counts and totals for the user's own eyes.

Design rules, so this can never become telemetry by accident:

- **Read-only.** No new tables, no new columns, no new event stream. If the
  feature were deleted tomorrow, not one byte of stored data would change.
- **No content.** Only aggregates (counts, sums, distributions over engine and
  language). The `text` column of a take is never read, never returned. Nothing
  here identifies a person, a file path, or what was said.
- **No network.** There is no client, no endpoint, no token. The data reaches
  exactly one place: the local HTTP response to the user's own UI.

That keeps the product's headline promise intact — *nothing leaves your
machine* — while still answering the question analytics was meant to answer.
