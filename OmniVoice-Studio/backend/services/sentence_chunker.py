"""Sentence chunker for streaming TTS (Wave 1.4 — /ws/tts polish).

Copyright (c) 2026 Patter Contributors. Ported behavior-identical (the
golden parity scenarios ship as fixtures in tests/test_sentence_chunker.py);
only this header differs.

Accumulates streaming text (LLM tokens or a whole request) and yields
complete sentences. Regex-based marker replacement handles abbreviations,
acronyms, decimals, websites, ellipsis, and CJK/non-Latin punctuation —
the terminator tables below contain functional CJK and are allowlisted in
tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py. Used by api/routers/tts_stream.py to
synthesize sentence-by-sentence for low time-to-first-audio.

# lists into a single regex alternation so the chunker handles mixed-language
# text correctly out of the box (this is the behaviour shipped since the
# SDK introduced sentence chunking; per-language constants are an
# organisational refactor that also lets callers verify per-language
# coverage in tests).
#
# Single-letter honorifics (French "M.", "A.") are deliberately omitted —
# they are handled by the existing ``\\s + alphabets + [.] `` rule which
# preserves any single-letter-period sequence.
