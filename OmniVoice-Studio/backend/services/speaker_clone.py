"""Speaker-clone extraction.

After diarisation assigns `speaker_id` to every segment, this module picks
the longest clean passage per speaker from the Demucs-isolated vocals track
and writes it as a per-speaker reference WAV. The reference, paired with the
corresponding transcript text, lets zero-shot TTS engines clone the
speaker's voice for dubbing — the central product promise of
"same speaker, new language."

Constraints we live with:
  * Zero-shot TTS wants 5–15 s of clean audio per reference. <5 s risks a
    thin clone; >15 s is wasted context.
  * The reference must be the actual speaker, not background music. Demucs
    handles that upstream — we read from `vocals.wav`, not the raw mix.
  * The accompanying transcript text must align with the audio slice or the
    TTS cloner will mis-align its phoneme lookups.

We don't promote these clones to the persistent voice library; they're
job-scoped (lives next to `seg_N.wav` under `dub_jobs/{id}/`). Users can
promote manually via "Save as Voice Profile" — out of scope here.
