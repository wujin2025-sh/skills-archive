"""Subprocess env builder for engine launchers (Phase 1 INST-12 + AUTH-04).

Every place that spawns an engine subprocess (sonitranslate, future
CosyVoice / IndexTTS subprocess backends from Phase 2) should call
`build_engine_env()` instead of constructing its own env dict ad-hoc.
That gives us ONE place to inject:

  - HF_TOKEN / YOUR_HF_TOKEN from the 3-source resolver (AUTH-04)
  - TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1 on Windows when the user enabled the
    Performance toggle (INST-12, issue #65)

The function returns a fresh dict (caller may further mutate before
passing to `subprocess.Popen(env=...)`).
