"""Acoustic echo cancellation for dictate-over-playback (parity Action 8b).

When the user dictates while VoiceStudio is *playing* audio (a TTS preview, a
dub render, a video), the loudspeaker signal leaks back into the microphone.
The streaming ASR on ``/ws/transcribe`` then transcribes that bleed as if it
were speech — the "it typed back what the app just said" symptom. A browser's
``getUserMedia({echoCancellation:true})`` would help, but its quality and even
its availability differ per platform/webview, which would make a *default*
feature behave differently on macOS/Windows/Linux — against the project's
cross-platform-parity rule. A server-side canceller behaves identically
everywhere, so it is the local-first, platform-neutral choice.

This is an NLMS (normalised least-mean-squares) time-domain adaptive filter
with a Geigel double-talk detector. It is a clean-room-grade *port* of
Patter's ``getpatter/audio/aec.py`` (MIT) — see docs/competitive-analysis.md,
Action 8. It is NOT production-grade DSP (WebRTC AEC3 / Speex AEC are); it is
a dependency-free, good-enough canceller that removes the steady-state echo
the ASR would otherwise hallucinate on.

Wiring (one instance per ``/ws/transcribe`` session — NOT thread-safe)::

    aec = NlmsEchoCanceller(sample_rate=16000)
    # Far-end: every PCM chunk the client is about to play through speakers.
    aec.push_far_end(playback_pcm_bytes)
    # Near-end: the mic PCM, cleaned before it reaches the ASR buffer.
    cleaned = aec.process_near_end(mic_pcm_bytes)
