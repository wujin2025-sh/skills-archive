"""
Bind-host resolution tests — guards against regressing the loopback default.

`backend/main.py` resolves its uvicorn bind host from `OMNIVOICE_BIND_HOST`
with a default of `127.0.0.1`. Binding to `0.0.0.0` by default would expose
every (currently unauthenticated) router on the user's LAN — see the security
note in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.

These tests don't boot uvicorn. They re-evaluate the resolution expression
used in `main.py`'s `__main__` block, both as a string-level guard against
edits that swap the default back to `0.0.0.0`, and as a behavioral guard
on the env-var override path.
