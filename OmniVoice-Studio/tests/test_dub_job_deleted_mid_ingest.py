"""#1252/#1253: a dub ingest failed with the toast ``ingest: 'mgw39lx3'``.

Two reports, same reporter, same session, four `dub:upload` actions in a row.
The entire user-facing error was eight characters of their own job id:

    ingest: 'mgw39lx3'
    Error: ingest: 'mgw39lx3'

That is ``str(KeyError("mgw39lx3"))`` — the repr of a dict key. ``KeyError``
does not put "a lookup failed" in its message, so `build_failure` faithfully
reported a value with no explanation attached to it.

The lookup that failed: ``ingest_pipeline`` finished with a bare
``_dub_jobs[job_id].update(...)``. Everything before it — demucs, scene
detection, thumbnailing — takes minutes, and ``DELETE /dub/history/{id}`` pops
the entry. Deleting an in-flight dub therefore raised ``KeyError`` from a
pipeline that was, by then, doing exactly what it was told.

Both halves are covered: the crash no longer happens, and no exception whose
``str()`` is a bare value can present itself to a user that way again.
