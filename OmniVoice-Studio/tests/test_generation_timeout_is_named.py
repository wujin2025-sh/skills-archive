"""A generate that ran out of time must say so, not "an error we don't recognize".

Reported in #1368 (macOS M3 Max, MPS, indextts2):

    RuntimeError: TTS engine stopped mid-generation with an error OmniVoice
    doesn't recognize. Retry once; if it keeps failing, please report it with
    the full trace. Underlying error: TimeoutError:

Note what follows the last colon: nothing. `TimeoutError` is routinely raised
with an empty message, so the user was asked to report a trace that says
nothing, about the one failure mode whose cause is entirely known.

The classification chain (#880/#919) already refuses to blame VRAM for network
and config failures. A deadline is the same kind of thing — a known class with
a specific remedy — and it was falling through to the catch-all. Worse, had it
carried an OOM-ish word it would have hit the memory branch and told the user
to press Flush for memory they never ran out of, which is precisely the class
bug #880 fixed.

Ordering matters here and is asserted: timeout is checked BEFORE oom, and
network keeps ownership of "read timed out" (a dying download, which it
explains better than a generic deadline would).
