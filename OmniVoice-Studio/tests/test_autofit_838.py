"""Autofit translation style — strict fit-to-slot (v0.3.8).

Autofit = Cinematic + a hard "never exceed the segment time" bound. In the
speech-rate fit pass that means the accepted upper ratio is 1.0 (fit within the
slot) instead of Cinematic's looser TOL_HIGH (1.08). Verifies the strict mode
keeps trimming past the loose tolerance and that the no-LLM path still degrades
gracefully.
