"""Missing audio has to reach the USER, not just the log (#1330).

Reported as "this app dosent generate me the last few sentences": the take
comes back clean and simply short, so nothing in the product ever says a
sentence went missing. #1360 added a WARNING log line — which records the bug
for us and tells the user nothing, because nobody reads a log to find out
whether the audio they just made is complete.

So the render now collects the text it lost and the response carries it:
headers on the classic path (the body is a WAV), a `warning` frame before
`done` on the streaming one. These tests pin the collection and both carriers;
the toast that renders them is covered by the frontend suite.
