"""#1405 — the VoiceDesign model never received the description it requires.

`MLXAudioBackend.generate` builds its kwargs by hand and forwards `voice`,
`ref_audio`, `ref_text` and `lang_code`. It did **not** forward `instruct`,
even though the comment directly above the block said it did:

    # Different engines accept different kwargs (voice for Kokoro, ref_audio
    # for CSM, instruct for Qwen3) — we pass them all …

The curated `qwen3-tts` model IS the VoiceDesign variant
(`Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign-4bit`), and mlx-audio raises outright when
that variant is generated without an `instruct`. So the engine could not
produce audio no matter what the user typed, and the report was a bare
`400 Bad Request` quoting a library message the app never explains.

Two things are pinned here: the description actually reaches the library, and
its absence produces an error a user can act on rather than the raw internal
one.
