"""A clone reference whose file is gone must not silently become a default voice.

Reported on Discord (in Russian):

    если переозвучивать отдельные предложения то голос не берется из видео,
    приходится все переозвучивать чтобы клон голоса сработал

    "If you re-dub individual sentences, the voice isn't taken from the video —
     you have to re-dub everything for the voice clone to work."

Clone references are FILE PATHS into the job's extracted-clip directory, and the
whole job dict — those paths included — is persisted to ``dub_history.job_data``
so saved projects reopen after a restart. The job therefore outlives its clips.
Reopen a saved dub once the clip directory has been cleaned, regenerate one
line, and every resolution branch happily hands the engine a path that is no
longer there.

Nothing checked it, and an engine given a missing reference renders **uncloned**
rather than failing — so the line comes back in a default voice, matching
nothing else in the dub, with no error anywhere. Re-running the full dub
re-extracts the clips, which is exactly why that appears to fix it and is the
workaround the reporter found on their own.

The change is diagnostic only: the reference is passed to the engine unchanged.
Nulling it would not alter what the user hears, and would decide on the
engine's behalf that a path it cannot ``stat`` is unusable. The defect is the
silence, not the fallback — so this does not change what happens, it changes
whether anyone can find out why.
