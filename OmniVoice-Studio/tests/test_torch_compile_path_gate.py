"""#1266: a torch lib path with whitespace can never survive inductor's linker.

Inductor passes the torch library directory to clang++/g++ as an unquoted
``-L`` flag, so a path containing a space splits into two arguments and the
compile dies with ``no such file or directory: 'Support/...'``. The bug is
inside PyTorch; what we control is not paying for a compile attempt that cannot
succeed and not flooding the log tail with its failure — which is how it turned
up in #1259, consuming a chunk of the captured crash output while not being the
actual fault.

Not hypothetical anywhere: macOS keeps app data under
``~/Library/Application Support/`` and a Windows profile is routinely
``C:/Users/First Last``.
