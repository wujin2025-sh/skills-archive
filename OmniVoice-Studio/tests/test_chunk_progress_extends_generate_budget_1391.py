"""A render that keeps finishing chunks is not "too heavy for the compute" (#1391).

The largest open cluster (#1338, #1348, #1391) is one shape: a long text on
modest hardware, rendered chunk by chunk under a single execution budget, dying
at 300s with "the backend is running, but this job was too heavy for the
available compute" — after most of its chunks had already rendered. The user
sees a hardware verdict about a job that was working the whole time.

#1367 solved the same disagreement for model DOWNLOADS: the guard now listens
to heartbeats instead of only its own clock. This applies that to synthesis,
where the proof of life is a completed chunk.

The distinction the guard must keep making: SLOW (chunks keep landing, however
far apart) versus WEDGED (nothing lands at all). The second half of this file
is that non-regression — the wedge guard is why the budget exists.

Timings are tenths of seconds via monkeypatched constants, so nothing here
races real hardware.
