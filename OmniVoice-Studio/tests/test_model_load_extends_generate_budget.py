"""A healthy model download must not be reported as too-slow hardware (#1367).

Every subprocess engine cold-loads its model inside the synthesize handler, so
a first-use generate on a slow connection spends its whole 300s execution
budget downloading — and then fails, blaming the hardware, while the sidecar's
own watchdog was being fed progress frames the entire time. The two clocks
disagreed about a job both could see was alive.

The fix makes the outer clock listen: sidecar progress frames are forwarded to
``report_model_load_activity()``, and the guarded waiter extends the deadline
past the soft budget only while those heartbeats stay fresh, bounded by
``MODEL_LOAD_EXTRA_TIMEOUT_S``. A job that goes SILENT still dies at the
original deadline (± one wait slice) — the guard this runner exists for is
untouched, and that non-regression is most of this file.

Timings here are tenths of seconds via monkeypatched module constants, so the
suite stays fast and none of it races real hardware.
