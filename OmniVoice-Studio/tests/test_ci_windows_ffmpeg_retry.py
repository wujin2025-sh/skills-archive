"""A retry that trusts a lying exit code is not a retry.

On 2026-07-28 the chocolatey community feed returned 503. `choco install
ffmpeg` printed "Unable to find package 'ffmpeg'" and "installed 0/0 packages"
— then exited **0**. The retry loop added on 2026-07-20 was written as
`choco install ... && break`, so it broke out on the first attempt, no backoff
ran, and the job died one line later on `ffmpeg: command not found`.

This runs the real loop body from ci.yml against a stubbed `choco` that
reproduces that behaviour, so the guard is pinned to what actually happened
rather than to what the exit code claimed.
