"""#34 runtime-verify — Layer 1 e2e for the longform chapterized renderer.

Drives the REAL `_render_longform_sse` generator and REAL ffmpeg, but injects a
stub synth (a CPU tone) so no GPU/model is needed. Proves the SSE event
sequence AND that ffmpeg actually muxes a playable, chapter-tagged file — the
cheap regression net over the audiobook/stories convergence (#21-era work).

Gated on ffmpeg being present so it's a no-op on a runner without it; it MUST
run in CI (where ffmpeg is installed). Exercises the non-happy states too:
empty plan, no-ffmpeg, per-chapter partial failure, total failure.
