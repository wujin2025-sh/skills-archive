"""Regression (#730 class; residual #850/#802/#755): a wedged GPU **generate**
must not brick the backend.

Before this fix, the TTS generate paths (`generation.py`, `tts_stream.py`)
dispatched to the GPU pool with no wall-clock bound and no recovery — unlike
ASR/dub/model-load, which already bound+reset on hang. On the 1–2 worker pools
we ship, one wedged generate (a Windows+CUDA hang) occupied its worker forever,
starving every other request so the next user action surfaced as the misleading
"Can't reach the local backend" even though the process was alive.

`run_on_gpu_pool_guarded` gives every GPU dispatch the same bound+reset recovery:
on timeout it abandons the wedged worker (pool `reset()`), restoring capacity,
and raises `GpuJobTimeoutError` with an actionable message.
