"""#1262: a non-Latin voice-profile name 500'd every download endpoint.

    500 Internal Server Error: 'latin-1' codec can't encode characters in
    position 22-25: ordinal not in range(256)

``attachment; filename="`` is exactly 22 characters long, so positions 22-25
were the first four characters of the reporter's own profile name. HTTP header
values are latin-1 by definition; every download endpoint interpolated the
filename straight into the header.

The sanitisers in front of those f-strings looked like they covered it — but
they all filtered with ``str.isalnum()``, which is ``True`` for *every*
alphabetic script. They stripped punctuation and let through exactly the
characters that break the header.

This was never one endpoint: the same ``isalnum()`` idiom was copy-pasted
across persona export, marketplace, stories, the OpenAI-compatible speech
route, and eight dub-export routes. All of them now go through one RFC 6266
builder, and a guard below keeps the next one from being written by hand.
