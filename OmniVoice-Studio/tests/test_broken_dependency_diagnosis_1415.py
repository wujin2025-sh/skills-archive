"""A broken dependency is not a missing install, and must not be silent (#1415).

The reporter's backend logged this at startup::

    ModuleNotFoundError: Could not import module 'AutoFeatureExtractor'.
        Are this object's requirements defined correctly?
      … in _lazy_omnivoice
        from omnivoice.models.omnivoice import OmniVoice as _OV   # line 40

Line 40 is the *second* import — the one after the #564 source-tree fallback —
which proves the fallback fired. It should never have: nothing about
``sys.path`` was wrong. transformers' lazy module raises
``ModuleNotFoundError`` for any attribute whose backing import failed, so a
broken torch/torchaudio/transformers environment arrives wearing the exact
exception type that means "the editable install of omnivoice is missing". The
handler re-imported from the same broken environment, failed identically, and
logged that the *editable install* was broken — sending the reporter, and us,
after the wrong component.

The second half is that the failure was invisible. Preload is deliberately
non-fatal, and nothing else touches the model until the user generates — so
the app starts clean, reports itself healthy, and simply produces nothing.
