"""A slow engine import is not a broken one (#1414).

Every subprocess engine confirms a candidate interpreter by spawning it and
importing the engine package. That probe used to have two outcomes, and a
bound that elapsed produced the *negative* one — so on the hosts where
``import indextts.infer_v2`` is slowest (cold page cache, spinning disk,
Windows AV scanning every DLL of a torch import), a working
``OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR`` install was discarded and the user was told the
engine was not installed, or got a 500 on the first generation after launch.

These pin the three properties that fix depends on:

* a timeout is reported as ``"unproven"``, never ``"no"``;
* an unproven candidate is used rather than declaring the engine missing,
  but only after every candidate has had a chance to prove itself outright;
* the bound is tunable per host, because "how slow is too slow" is a
  property of the machine and not of the code.

Fail-before/pass-after: with the old two-state probe every one of these
either raises "not installed" or resolves the wrong interpreter.
