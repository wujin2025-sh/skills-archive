"""Translation must work on LM Studio, not just on Ollama (#1332).

A user reported that translation works through Ollama and fails through LM
Studio on the same machine — a clean A/B that rules out the surrounding
pipeline. The cause is in the provider table: LM Studio's `default_model` was
the string ``"local-model"``, which is a placeholder and not a model id. LM
Studio serves whatever the user has loaded and rejects a name it does not know,
so every request 404s. Ollama's default is ``llama3.1`` — a real name that
people actually pull — so the same code path worked there.

There is no name we could ship that would be right, because the answer depends
on what the user loaded. So the fix asks the server, and these tests pin the
parts that would silently regress: that discovery never overrides a user's
explicit choice, that it stays off for providers with real defaults, and that a
server which is down or empty leaves the caller no worse off.
