"""#1223: a port conflict must exit with a code the shell can recognise.

The reporter's backend died with `[Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind
on address ('127.0.0.1', 3900)` — port already taken, almost certainly by an
orphan from a previous session. uvicorn re-raised the bare OSError, Python
exited 1, and the desktop shell reported "Backend died (exit code 1)" with no
cause: the Windows wording is OS-translated (the report was in Russian), so no
English phrase in the log could be matched.

The fix is to make the signal locale-independent — a dedicated exit code that
`frontend/src-tauri/src/backend.rs` and `frontend/src/utils/backendCrash.ts`
both key off. This test pins the code and its cross-language agreement; the
matcher side is pinned in frontend/src/test/portInUseHint.test.js.
