"""The dictation model picker must not lie about download size.

Every one of the seven `size_gb` values was wrong, and — unusually — in both
directions, which is worse than being uniformly optimistic:

  * the two 0.6B Parakeets under-reported by ~3.8x (0.18 -> 0.67 GB). The
    recommended default therefore downloaded four times what the picker
    promised, which matters on a metered connection or a small SSD.
  * the two small zipformers OVER-reported by ~3x (0.128 -> 0.044 GB). Those
    are the low-RAM fallbacks — the models a user drops to when the 0.6B one
    is too heavy for their machine — and they were advertised as bulkier than
    they are, discouraging exactly the choice that would have helped.

`test_declared_sizes_match_the_published_repos` is the real check: it sums the
pinned files from the HuggingFace tree API and compares. It needs the network,
so it is opt-in via RUN_NETWORK_TESTS=1 and skipped in ordinary CI. The offline
tests below hold the line without it — they encode the measurement taken on
2026-08-07 so a hand-edit or a stale copy-paste fails locally and in CI.

Re-measure with:
