"""The torch trio must stay coupled on the `uv pip install` paths (#1357).

`pyproject.toml` declares `torch>=2.4`, `torchaudio>=2.4`, `torchvision>=0.19`
independently, because no PEP 508 syntax expresses "these three move together".
The coupling lives in `[tool.uv] constraint-dependencies`.

That setting is part of the **project** API — `uv sync`, `uv lock`, `uv run`.
`uv pip install` is the pip-compatible interface and ignores it. Both install
paths that use `uv pip install --system` (the Colab notebook and the Docker
image) therefore resolved the trio on its bare lower bounds, free to upgrade
torch while leaving a torchvision built against an older ABI in place:

    RuntimeError: operator torchvision::nms does not exist

That is #1357, reported on Colab, where the stale torchvision sat in the
preinstalled `/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/`.

Verified directly rather than assumed: with the pin present only in
`constraint-dependencies`, `uv pip install --dry-run .` into a clean
environment resolves torchvision **0.28.0**, not the pinned 0.23.0.

So the pin is passed explicitly via `--constraint`, and these tests fail if the
file drifts from pyproject, if either call site stops passing it, or if the
Docker guard stops covering torchvision.
