"""Startup migration safety net (feat/safe-updates).

`core.db._run_alembic_upgrade` must:

- snapshot the DB *before* pending migrations run (and name the snapshot
  ``omnivoice.db.backup-<version>-<n>``),
- NOT snapshot when the DB is already at head (no churn on every launch),
- keep the pre-existing non-fatal behavior for the "nothing was applied"
  classes (#552/#547: stamped at a removed revision → warn + reconcile),
- and on a migration that fails WHILE executing: stop startup with
  ``MigrationError`` naming the backup path — never auto-restore, never
  continue on a half-migrated DB.
