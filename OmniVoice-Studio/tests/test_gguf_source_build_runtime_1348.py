"""#1348 — a source-built GGUF runtime must actually run.

Two independent failures from the same report (LXC Debian, CPU-only,
built from source):

1. ``scripts/build-omnivoice-tts.sh`` copied only the executable out of the
   temp build tree; a dynamically-linked build (buildcpu.sh, or cmake with
   BLAS present) left its ``libggml*`` shared libraries behind for the EXIT
   trap to delete, so the shipped binary died on first spawn with exit 127
   — "libggml.so.0: cannot open shared object file".
2. ``_GENERATE_TIMEOUT_S`` was hardcoded to 120s, which reaped legitimate
   CPU-only generates mid-synthesis with no way to raise it.
