All notable changes to OmniVoice Studio.

## [Unreleased]

- **Not shipped yet.** Should never appear in the viewer.

## [0.3.9] — 2026-07-02

The dictation release — one-paragraph headline.

### Added

- **Dictation, rebuilt.** Live waveform, ~0.5 s commit, clean punctuation. (#123)
- **LLM provider testing.** Latency + classified errors. (#887)

### Fixed

- **CUDA transcription works on packaged installs.** The compat libs now install at launch. (#827, #869)

## [0.3.8] — 2026-07-01

A stability-focused release that makes first-run and Windows "just work," ships
**live dictation** and more.

### Added

- **"Autofit" translation quality — the dub keeps the video's timing.** A new
  quality alongside Fast and Cinematic: the LLM rewrites each translated line so
  it fits. (#838)
- **A new LLM Providers settings page.** One page for **16 providers**. (#850)

## [0.3.7] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Old bug.** Squashed. (#700)

## [0.3.6] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Older still.** (#600)
