"""Out-of-process backend probe, executed by env.capture_first_run().

Runs in its OWN process so it never mutates the parent test session's module
table or environment (in-process booting purges/re-imports the backend, which
corrupts DB_PATH for other tests — see env.py). Boots the FastAPI app against a
data dir and captures, in a single boot, everything the L5/engine/security/
coverage probes need:

  - first-run endpoints (health / system info / model status): status/body/latency
  - DB creation on first boot
  - TTS + ASR engine matrices (/engines/tts, /engines/asr)
  - loopback-rejection of a system endpoint from a non-loopback origin
  - the OpenAPI path inventory (for the Coverage Critic)

Writes the captured context as JSON to the output path. Not a test module.
