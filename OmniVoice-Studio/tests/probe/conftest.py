"""probe pytest plumbing: a session-scoped result recorder that emits an HTML
report (and opens it) when the probe suite finishes.

Tests record outcomes via the ``probe_report`` fixture. At session end the
recorded outcomes are rendered to ``tests/probe/reports/report-*.html`` and
opened in the browser (suppressed in CI / headless / when ``PROBE_NO_OPEN``).

This conftest is imported by pytest as ``probe.conftest`` (the probe package),
so relative imports resolve; a sys.path fallback covers odd invocations.
