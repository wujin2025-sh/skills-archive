"""#1227 / #1221: two synth failures that dead-ended in the catch-all.

``_oom_friendly_reraise`` classifies every known way a generate can die and
re-raises with the real remedy; anything it doesn't recognize surfaces as
"TTS engine stopped mid-generation with an error OmniVoice doesn't recognize".
Two real reports landed there:

* #1227 — ``OSError: [WinError 4551] An Application Control policy has blocked
  this file``. Windows Smart App Control refused to load an engine binary;
  nothing about memory, and the Flush button can't help.
* #1221 — ``LibsndfileError: System error.``, libsndfile's bare wording for an
  OS-level audio read/write failure. No path, no errno, no next step.

These tests pin both classes, the shared docs taxonomy, and the write-path
diagnosis that turns "System error." into a message naming the target file.
