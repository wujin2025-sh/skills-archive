"""PocketTTS sidecar unit tests (#1306 / #1328).

The sidecar is stdlib-only at import time (torch + pocket_tts load lazily on the
first synthesize), so everything below runs without the optional `pocket-tts`
wheel installed and without spawning a child process — the model is mocked.

These pin the four review findings that were fixed on the PR, each of which is
silent-by-construction and would regress without a test:

* an unsupported language used to fall back to English and mispronounce
  (greptile P1) — it now raises;
* the defensive downmix assumed channels-first and destroyed a channels-last
  waveform (CodeRabbit) — it now raises;
* the cold-load heartbeat thread and the main loop both write frames, so a
  heartbeat firing mid-write interleaved the length and body segments and
  corrupted the wire (greptile P1) — writes are now serialized;
* a reference clip replaced at the same path served the previous voice from
  cache (greptile P1) — the cache key carries an mtime+size fingerprint.
