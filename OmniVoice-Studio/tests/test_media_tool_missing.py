"""#1256: a synth failed with a raw `FileNotFoundError: … 'ffprobe'`.

The reporter's toast, on a Mac with the app's own ffprobe sitting on disk:

    Couldn't synthesize audio. … Underlying error: RuntimeError: TTS engine
    stopped mid-generation with an error OmniVoice doesn't recognize. Retry
    once; if it keeps failing, please report it with the full trace.
    Underlying error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
    'ffprobe'

Two separate defects, fixed here as two halves:

1. **It happened at all.** Every OmniVoice call site resolves ffmpeg/ffprobe
   explicitly (`find_ffprobe()`), which is why a bundled sidecar that was never
   on ``PATH`` works for us. Our dependencies get no such courtesy — one that
   shells out to ``ffprobe`` by bare name finds nothing. Publishing the
   resolved directories on ``PATH`` fixes every such dependency at once.

2. **It was illegible.** "an error OmniVoice doesn't recognize" is what the
   generic engine wrapper says when `classify()` returns "" — and it did,
   because nothing matched a missing media binary. It now names the class and
   points at Settings → Audio tools.
