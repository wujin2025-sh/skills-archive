"""Token/path-safety contract for routing reasons (GPU compat matrix, PR 1).

``resolve_routing`` returns raw author strings, but any reason that interpolates
a ``device_name`` or probe note can carry a home path — so the serialization
layer scrubs it with ``core.scrub.scrub_text``. These tests pin that a reason
built from a home-path-bearing note comes out clean after scrubbing, and that a
``None`` reason must NOT be passed through ``scrub_text`` (which would turn it
into ``""`` instead of JSON ``null``).
