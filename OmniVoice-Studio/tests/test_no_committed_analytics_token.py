"""The analytics token lives in exactly two canonical files — nowhere else.

History: gitleaks once caught a hardcoded PostHog key in analytics.ts, and the
repo banned token-shaped literals outright (build-time injection only). Owner
reversal #1193: source builds now ship the same consent-gated analytics as
installers, so the *publishable* project token (write-only event ingestion, not
data access — PostHog's client keys are designed to ship in client code) is
committed as an in-repo default in the two files that implement analytics:

    backend/core/analytics.py        (_PUBLIC_PROJECT_TOKEN)
    frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts  (PUBLIC_PROJECT_TOKEN)

This guard pins the new contract: a `phc_` literal may exist ONLY there, both
files must actually carry one, and the two must be the SAME token (one PostHog
project — a drifted pair would silently split the event stream). The build-time
override chain (env / baked secret beats the in-repo default) stays pinned
below. Same file-scanning idiom as test_no_hardcoded_cjk / test_no_literal_borders.
