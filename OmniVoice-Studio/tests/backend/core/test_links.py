"""Tests for backend/core/links.py — project repo URL resolver.

The module owns the single source of truth for the GitHub repo URL used by
error → docs deeplinks (and, in Phase 5, by the prefilled bug-report URL).
The 4 tests below pin the resolution order:

  1. Tauri config endpoint wins when present.
  2. Falls back to pyproject's Repository URL when Tauri is unreadable.
  3. The derived `BLOB_MAIN` constant is always `<URL>/blob/main`.
  4. The URL always starts with `https://github.com/`.
