"""Tests for GET /setup/recommendations — the per-platform curated preset.

The preset is data-driven from ``curated_on`` in ``backend/config/models.yaml``
(TTS-only-required change): only the TTS model is required, and each host
family gets its own curated ASR/TTS picks. These tests pin the resolution
logic per family by mocking ``_current_platform_tags`` — no hardware or
network needed.
