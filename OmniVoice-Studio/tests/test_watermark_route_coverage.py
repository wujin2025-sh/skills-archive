"""Structural guard: no synthesis call site can ship without provenance marking.

The #1169 class: watermark coverage grew call-site-by-call-site (three
separate ``embed_watermark`` calls) until a fourth producer —
``/v1/audio/speech`` — shipped synthetic audio with no mark at all, with EU AI
Act Art. 50(2) applying from 2026-08-02. The fix is ONE chokepoint,
``services.watermark.mark_synthetic``; this guard makes the chokepoint
structurally load-bearing:

1. Every backend module that invokes a TTS synthesis primitive must reference
   ``mark_synthetic`` — or sit in the justified allowlist below. A future
   audio route that synthesizes without marking fails here before it ships.
2. Known producers must KEEP their ``mark_synthetic`` call (deleting one fails).
3. ``embed_watermark`` may not be called outside ``services/watermark.py`` —
   new code physically can't bypass the chokepoint's logging/uniformity.
4. Allowlist entries must still match the synthesis pattern (no stale
   exemptions accumulating).

Behavioral (detect-on-response) coverage per route lives in
tests/test_synthetic_audio_watermark_1169.py.
