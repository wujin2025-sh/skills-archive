"""#1309: an ffmpeg failure reported its build configuration, not the fault.

ffmpeg and ffprobe print a version + configuration banner to STDERR on every
invocation, before doing any work. When a command fails we capture that stderr
and it becomes the error message, so the reporter saw:

    extract: ffmpeg version N-125781-gacf6b520c1-20260727 Copyright (c) 2000-2026 …
      built with gcc 15.2.0 (crosstool-NG …)
      configuration: --prefix=/ffbuild/prefix --pkg-config-flags=--static …

— several hundred characters of build flags, and not one word about why the
extract failed. The diagnosis is always *after* the banner.
