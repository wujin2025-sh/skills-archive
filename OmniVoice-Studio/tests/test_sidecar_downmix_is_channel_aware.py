"""Every sidecar's defensive downmix must pick the channel axis, not axis 0.

Found while reviewing #1328: the PocketTTS sidecar's `arr.mean(axis=0)` assumed
channels-first. For a channels-last `(N, 2)` array `squeeze()` keeps both axes
and the mean runs across **time** — every output sample becomes the mean of two
neighbouring samples. That is not a downmix; it is a destroyed waveform, at half
the expected length, played back as noise.

The same line was in five already-merged sidecars. Unreachable in all of them
today, since every engine returns mono — which is exactly why it could sit there
being wrong: nothing runs it, so nothing reports it, and the first engine or SDK
version to emit stereo gets noise with no error anywhere.

The sidecars run under *different interpreters* (confucius4 and dots.tts each
have their own venv), so they cannot import a shared helper — the duplication is
structural and cannot be refactored away. This test is the mitigation: it holds
all of them to the same behaviour at once, so a sixth copy pasted into a new
sidecar fails here rather than shipping.
