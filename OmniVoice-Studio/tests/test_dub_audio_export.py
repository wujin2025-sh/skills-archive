       must disable normalization outright (normalize=0 + per-input gains);
       amix's normalization is DYNAMIC, so the naive fix (a constant post-mix
       compensation) over-boosts the bed after the voice stream ends.

       44.1 kHz bed was silently downsampled — everything above 12 kHz gone.
       Both inputs must be resampled UP to the mix rate before amix.
