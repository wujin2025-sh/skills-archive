"""Audiobook render stops on client disconnect (#1216).

"The Create audiobook button has no stop option." The frontend fix aborts the
fetch on Stop; this pins the BACKEND half: ``_render_longform_sse`` polls
``is_disconnected()`` at each chapter boundary and, when the client is gone,
stops scheduling further chapters instead of rendering the whole book into a
stream nobody reads — while leaving the finished chapters cached and the resume
manifest in place so a later Create/resume finishes the rest cheaply.

No models / GPU: the synth boundary is stubbed (a CPU tone), exactly like the
longform e2e. ffmpeg is never reached on the stop path (we break before
assembling), so it's stubbed truthy only to clear the early gate.
