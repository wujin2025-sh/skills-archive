/**
 * The dictation widget window is a hidden host, and it must never be able to
 * decide it is the main window.
 *
 * The reported symptom was a dark, empty, square-cornered rectangle that
 * appeared on every dictation trigger and survived until the app was killed.
 * It measured exactly 300x64 — the widget window's declared size — and the
 * pill it should have contained is a capsule (`border-radius: 100px`), so what
 * was on screen was the WINDOW painting its own background with no pill in it.
 *
 * One cause explains all three properties. `detectIsWidget()` asked
 * `getCurrentWindow().label`, which throws while Tauri's internals are still
 * being injected; the catch then fell back to a URL query that Tauri 2 cannot
 * set, so the answer was "I am the main window". From there:
 *
 *   - `data-window="widget"` was never set  → opaque chrome background
 *   - `<App/>` rendered instead of the pill → empty
 *   - the idle-hide reconcile lives inside CaptureWidget, which never mounted
 *     → nothing in the process could hide it again
 *
 * The fix is an initialization_script (lib.rs) that stamps
 * `window.__OV_WINDOW__` before any page script runs. An init script cannot
 * race a readiness check, because there is nothing left to be ready for.
 *
 * These tests pin the frontend half: the marker wins over the API, and it is
 * still believed when the Tauri API is unavailable — the exact condition that
 * used to produce the stranded rectangle.
