/**
 * backendLifecycle — frontend bridge to the desktop shell's backend lifecycle
 * (src-tauri/src/bootstrap.rs).
 *
 * The shell always knows whether the backend process is starting, ready,
 * being auto-restarted by the supervisor (#567), or terminally failed — but
 * until this module, api/client.ts guessed: it retried a transport failure
 * for ~2.9 s and then threw "Can't reach the local VoiceStudio backend", while
 * a real backend start/restart takes 10–20+ s (venv spawn + torch import).
 * Every request that landed in that window dead-ended with the scary toast,
 * which is why the error "kept coming up" on every restart/cold-start race.
 *
 * `backendLifecycleStage()` asks the shell (`bootstrap_status`) so the client
 * can keep waiting exactly as long as a start/restart is actually in
 * progress, and give up immediately when the shell says failed.
 *
 * Outside the Tauri shell (browser dev, Docker, LAN share) there is no shell
 * to ask — the stage is 'unknown' and callers keep today's short-retry
 * behavior.
 *
 * #1177: the shell's `BootstrapStage::Failed { message }` carries the WHOLE
 * diagnosis — exit code plus a ~30-line stderr tail, or the precise reason
 * `ensure_venv_ready` refused (Intel Mac, a failed `uv sync`, a blocked
 * GitHub). This module used to return only the stage tag and throw that
 * message away, so every backend-start failure collapsed into apiFetch's
 * evidence-free "Can't reach the local VoiceStudio backend" — the shell knew
 * exactly what went wrong and the frontend structurally could not read it.
 * The stage probe now returns `{ stage, message }` and callers surface it.
