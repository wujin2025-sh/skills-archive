/**
 * Frontend analytics (posthog-js) — consent-gated, autocapture OFF.
 *
 * The usual integration is one line at module load:
 *
 *     posthog.init(TOKEN, { api_host, defaults: '2026-05-30' })
 *
 * That is wrong for this app, twice over, and the reasons are not theoretical:
 *
 * 1. **It would track everyone immediately, before consent.** VoiceStudio's whole
 *    promise is that a default install sends nothing (Settings → Privacy is OFF
 *    until you turn it on; see backend/core/analytics.py). Initialising at load
 *    would make the app's own README a lie. So init happens ONLY after the user
 *    has opted in, and never before.
 *
 * 2. **posthog-js autocaptures DOM interactions by default** — clicks, form
 *    interactions, and the *text content* of the elements involved. In this app
 *    the DOM holds the script the user is about to synthesise, their voice names,
 *    and their file names. Autocapture would exfiltrate precisely the content we
 *    promise never leaves the machine. It is explicitly disabled, along with
 *    session recording (which would record the screen) and pageview capture.
 *
 * What we send instead is a small set of deliberate events with metadata-only
 * properties, filtered through the same allowlist the backend uses — so no
 * future caller can leak content by adding a field.
 *
 * The project token is a *publishable* key (PostHog's client tokens are designed
 * to ship in client code); it grants write-only event ingestion, not data access.

 * In-repo default destination (owner-sanctioned reversal, #1193): source builds
 * get the SAME consent-gated analytics as installers. This is a PostHog
 * *publishable* client key — write-only event ingestion, no data access;
 * PostHog's own FAQ says these are designed to ship in client code — NOT a
 * secret. It only names a destination: nothing is ever sent without the user's
 * explicit opt-in (init happens only after consent, see enableAnalytics()).
 * A build-time VITE_POSTHOG_KEY (release builds; developers pointing at their
 * own project) always wins over it — mirrors backend/core/analytics.py.
