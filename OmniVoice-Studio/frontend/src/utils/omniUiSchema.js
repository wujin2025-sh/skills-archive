/**
 * Schema guard for the persisted `omni_ui` localStorage blob.
 *
 * The #1067 class ("app got empty" after quit-mid-job) was healed per-field —
 * dubStep got a clamp, vdStates got a shape merge — but every OTHER field was
 * restored unvalidated inside one big try/catch, so (a) any future persisted
 * field re-opens the class, and (b) a single malformed value (say, dubSegments
 * saved as a string by a buggy build) throws mid-restore and silently discards
 * every field after it. This is the generic pass the audit called for: a
 * whitelist of known keys with a type/shape check each; unknown keys and
 * malformed values are dropped (with one console warning naming them) instead
 * of crashing or leaking into state.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a validation library: predicates only, no coercion — a
 * value that fails its predicate is exactly the value we don't want in state.
