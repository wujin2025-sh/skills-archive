/**
 * Hold the in-flight count for the duration of `fn`.
 *
 * Safe to nest, and streaming relies on that: generateSpeech releases its
 * claim when the Response resolves — i.e. when the HEADERS arrive — but a
 * streaming synth reads the body for as long as it takes to generate. Wrapping
 * the whole stream in an outer claim keeps the count above zero throughout;
 * the inner one just bumps it to 2 and back. This only works because the store
 * tracks a COUNT, not a boolean (Greptile P1, #1288).
