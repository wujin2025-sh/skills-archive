![VoiceStudio — the open-source ElevenLabs alternative](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/main/.github/assets/social-preview.png)

VoiceStudio runs entirely on your own hardware (CUDA / MPS / ROCm / CPU
auto-detect) — nothing is sent to the cloud. This image is the **headless
web-server build**: a FastAPI backend serving a pre-built React UI over HTTP, so
you can run it on a homelab box, a GPU server, or anywhere Docker runs and open
the UI in a browser.

> The Tauri desktop app's auto-updater and update-channel toggle are
> **desktop-only** and do not apply to this image — to update, pull a newer tag
> and recreate the container.

**What you need:** 8 GB RAM (16 GB+ recommended), ~10 GB free disk for model
weights + cache (20 GB+ comfortable), and optionally a GPU — 4 GB VRAM works
(TTS auto-offloads to CPU), 8 GB+ is comfortable. No GPU at all is fine too:
the entire pipeline runs on CPU, just slower. Pull size: ~5 GB compressed
(CUDA/CPU image), ~15 GB for the `:rocm` variant.

## Quick start (CPU)

```bash
docker run -d --name omnivoice \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3900:3900 \
  -v omnivoice-data:/app/omnivoice_data \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  palashdeb/omnivoice-studio:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:3900>. The first run downloads a few GB of model weights —
follow `docker logs -f omnivoice` to watch progress.

## Quick start (NVIDIA GPU)

```bash
docker run -d --name omnivoice --gpus all \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3900:3900 \
  -v omnivoice-data:/app/omnivoice_data \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  palashdeb/omnivoice-studio:latest
```

GPU mode needs the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
on the host.

## Quick start (AMD GPU / ROCm)

AMD GPUs use the dedicated `:rocm` image variant (the default image is
CUDA-only and runs on CPU on AMD hardware). No toolkit needed — pass the GPU
through as device nodes; the host only needs the `amdgpu` kernel driver:

```bash
docker run -d --name omnivoice \
  --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3900:3900 \
  -v omnivoice-data:/app/omnivoice_data \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  palashdeb/omnivoice-studio:rocm
```

Podman users: same two `--device` flags (Quadlet: `AddDevice=/dev/kfd` +
`AddDevice=/dev/dri`). On RDNA3 consumer cards (RX 7900 XTX/XT), add
`-e HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0` if the GPU isn't detected — details in
the [Docker install guide](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/blob/main/docs/install/docker.md).

There's also a Compose file in the repo with `cpu` / `gpu` / `rocm` profiles
— see the [Docker install guide](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/blob/main/docs/install/docker.md).

## Image tags

| Tag | What you get |
|-----|--------------|
| `:latest` | **Rolling preview** — latest commit on `main`, at or ahead of the last release. This is the preview channel; pin `:stable` for production. |
| `:stable` | Most recent versioned release (updated on every `v*` git tag) |
| `:0.4.1` | Exact release version |
| `:0.4` | Latest patch within the `0.4` minor |
| `:main` | Alias of the same rolling `main` build as `:latest` |
| `:sha-xxxxxxx` | A specific commit (produced by manual workflow dispatch) |
| `:rocm` | **AMD GPU (ROCm) build** of the rolling preview — the ROCm analogue of `:latest` |
| `:stable-rocm`, `:0.4.1-rocm`, `:0.4-rocm`, `:sha-xxxxxxx-rocm` | ROCm builds of the corresponding tags above |

Preview builds always come from `main` and never version-sort below `:stable`,
so upgrades flow naturally. The same images and tags
are mirrored on GHCR at
[`ghcr.io/debpalash/omnivoice-studio`](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/pkgs/container/omnivoice-studio).

## What's inside

- **🎙️ Voice Cloning** — a 3-second clip mirrors any voice, zero-shot, in 646 languages.
- **🎨 Voice Design** — dial in gender, age, accent, pitch, speed, emotion, and dialect.
- **🎬 Video Dubbing** — YouTube URL or file → transcribe → translate → re-voice → MP4.
- **📖 Audiobook & long-form** — script → plan → loudness-normalized M4B with chapters, metadata, and cover art.
- **🔊 Vocal Isolation** — Demucs splits speech from music and keeps the background.
- **👥 Speaker Diarization** — Pyannote + WhisperX auto-identify who said what.
- **📦 Batch Queue** — drop 50 videos and walk away; per-job progress.
- **🤖 MCP Server** — drive VoiceStudio from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client.
- **🛡️ AI Watermark** — invisible AudioSeal (Meta) marking that survives compression.
- **⚡ GPU Auto-Detect** — CUDA · MPS · ROCm · CPU, with auto-offload on ≤8 GB cards.
- **🧩 Extensible** — subclass `TTSBackend` to add any engine in ~50 lines.

Multiple TTS engines ship out of the box (IndexTTS, CosyVoice, Supertonic-3, and
more), auto-detected and selectable in Settings.

## Volumes worth persisting

| Mount | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `omnivoice-data:/app/omnivoice_data` | Project DB, user voices, settings, encrypted HF token — survives upgrades |
| `~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface` | HF model cache — reuse the host cache to skip multi-GB re-downloads |

## Configuration & networking

- The container binds uvicorn to `0.0.0.0` internally; the host-side
  `127.0.0.1:3900:3900` mapping is what keeps it loopback-only. Change the
  mapping to `0.0.0.0:3900:3900` for LAN access.
- Behind a reverse proxy on a different origin, set
  `-e OMNIVOICE_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://api.your-host.example` so the UI targets
  the right API base (works on the prebuilt image; no rebuild needed).
- The image ships with `OMNIVOICE_SERVER_MODE=1`, which relaxes the desktop-only
  loopback-origin gate so the admin UI works through Docker's NAT. Set it to `0`
  if you front the container with your own loopback auth proxy.

> **Security:** VoiceStudio ships **no authentication**. Anything that can reach the
> URL can use the app. Before exposing it beyond localhost, put it behind a
> reverse proxy with auth (Caddy `basic_auth`, nginx + htpasswd) or a private
> overlay (Tailscale, ZeroTier).
